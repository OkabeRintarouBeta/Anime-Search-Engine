However, two of the cafe characters have disappeared without explanation (or maybe it was really briefly mentioned and I just forgot about it?). 
 
The story feels the most cohesive out of all the other four seasons - there's a distinct issue that's made clear from the get-go and each episode follows the main character as he works towards remedying that issue; there aren't really full filler episodes that don't contribute anything toward the progression of the story like there were abundant throughout the previous series.  
 
The opening theme used feels strangely unfitting, while the ending theme reverts back to the slightly grating song from the first season (it's apparently sung by Aoi but he's not even relevant any more...) 
 
Going meta the last few episodes was amusing. However, the ending I felt was terrible - introducing a faceless fangirl and then abruptly ending the entire series on such a strange note.

","The story about a human and an android that helping human is pretty much common in these days. We can say ""Sora no Otonoshimo, chobits, Eve no jikan, and many others"". They present the same things, its about an android (a robot that looks like a human) that helping their master. But neither those anime really hook me off, until i met Kowarekake no Orgel. 
 
STORY (9/10) 
There isnt any strong linear plot on this anime. but basically, Kowarekake no Orgel is focussing on how Keiichiro Kawada spending time with Flower (his android) on the summer days. So what's the fun? 
 
The synopsis may sounds boring, but dont be arrogant. Honestly this anime is great at presenting the story especially the drama within in the story. While many 1 episode anime is rushing the story, but not in Kowareka no Orgel. The story is quite slow and very alluring,furthermore the way how the present every scenes its  pretty enchanting and . The way how they bring the audience feelings (in this case, me) is pretty smooth. There isnt any exaggerate moments, Kowarekake made it naturally like the water flow in the river even in the ending, i dont realize if my tears had fallen. 
 
 
ART (8/10) 
The art in this anime is pretty nice. The background is so bright and pretty details too. Furthermore, its really suitable with the animation itself. The background itself improving the atmosphere that happen in the series, like colorful and bright background makes us (the viewers) realize that this is on happy and cheerful moments and we cant help to feel the happy too. But beside of all that, the quality in this art is pretty common for the other anime. 
 The character design is pretty much adorable too. Especially flower, she is pretty cute and really likeable character. 
 
SOUND (8/10) 
As for the ""music"" genre, i didnt really notice any songs in this anime. But beside of that, the BGM in this anime is really touchy and improving the emotion feels. With some piano sound, its really hyped up the mood. Especially in the ending, the BGM that using music boxes is pretty calming and touching. At that time, i cant help to shed my tears. and for The voice actor, they did a good job, every seiyuu in this anime really liven up the characters. 
 
CHARACTER (9/10) 
The characters in this anime is really likeable. Like i said before, Flower is maybe can turn you into a lolicon. The cheerful and clumsy personality that she has really makes the show became more attractive and beside Flower, we have Keiichiro as the main character. Keiichiro is more taciturn and quiet, but thats what makes this pairing become more interesting since they're filling each of their shortage. and within 28 minutes of the show, we will see a great development character especially on Keiichiro. 
 
OVERALL (9/10) 
Kowarekake no Orgel is an amazing one episode anime. With just 28 minutes, we like having a complex package of emotional things. You will feel happy at the moment but after a while you will feel sad or maybe ended up crying. What i really love is the way how this anime ended up, The ending is really satisfying and the most important thing is logic. So, basically if you want to have a  heartwarming stories with some deeply emotion on it, This anime is the one i can recommend to you.

       Helpful This 'movie' is only 20 or so minutes long, and is only one part. The movie leaves things open for the viewer to figure out as they are watching it. Many of the few characters were bland, in fact there was only one character I really enjoyed, and it was because in the beginning she was too cute to hate. It was a short movie, that I myself wouldn't have mind if it was a 12 episode series. If it was a series I would be more inclined to grow attached to the characters. The emotions the show tried to bring didn't really come to me, so it sadly failed at that. Over all, it wasn't bad, just too short.

","I love this anime 
I'm a mild depression just because a 30-minute movie anime :'( 
 
This movie is actually an alternative to the ovanya can be said still recap from the OVA but there is little scene in the add

This movie revolves around Keiichiro, a young man who has lost his family and his passion for music, and Flower, an outdated, clumsy helper-android with a bad memory. The two meet at a garbage site, where Keiichiro finds himself unable to leave her behind, despite the fact that someone has obviously thrown her away. From there, the story broadcasts their day-to-day lives as the bond between these two lonesome individuals develops into a beautiful friendship. 
 
Being that it is so short on time, it really is straightforward and to the point, you aren＊t really given any information that you don＊t need. Some characters are introduced, but never really developed, so because of that it may seem lacking from time to time. But overall this movie is a good one, and definitely worth the thirty minutes it takes to watch.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Super Power']","Set in the near future in the Great Era of Detectives, chosen people are born with supernatural abilities known as Toys (玄奶朮, Toizu). Those who use these Toys for evil are responsible for a wave of crimes and necessitate employing Toy-using detectives to help solve them. In the Yokohama District, Opera Kobayashi runs a detective agency named Milky Holmes, made up of four budding young detectives, Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Barton and Cordelia Glauca, who each wield their own unique toys and train to become detectives at Holmes Detective Academy.
The video game casts players in the role of Kobayashi, who must utilise Milky Holmes' unique abilities to stop the Thieves' Empire, a band of thieves led by the mysterious Ars谷ne. The second puts players in the role of another detective, Ellery Himeyuri. The Alternative TV specials also take place in this universe, in which Kobayashi and Milky Holmes are assisted by another Toy user, Lily Adler, in fighting against the Thieves' Empire whilst visiting London.
In the first two anime television series, the four girls of Milky Holmes, Sherlock, Nero, Hercule and Cordelia, end up losing their Toys during an encounter with the Thieves' Empire. Taken away from their rich lifestyle and thrown into an attic, the girls must try to regain use of their Toys or else face expulsion from Holmes Detective Academy. Futari wa Milky Holmes, which takes place two years after the other series, follows two young girls, Alice and Kazumi, who, inspired by Milky Holmes, form their own detective unit, Feathers, and fight against a group of thieves known as the Color the Phantom. Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.
","As a rule of thumb, the longer a media franchise remains active, the more likely it is to gravitate away from its original charm points. Granted, change or experiments are never necessarily a bad thing, but in the case of Milky Homes, they've overstayed their welcome shortly after they arrived. 
 
Anyone acquainted with Tantei Opera Milky Holmes- or, hell, anyone who so much as saw images of it- knows that it's not particularly melodramatic or deep. It's quirky, zany, wild, and arguably shallow; but I, for one, wouldn't have it any other way. The first season's comedic direction successfully produced hilarious results, later to be improved to downright masterful levels in the the second season, Dai 2 Maku. By all means, it was the franchise's prime, but almost inevitably, such levels of quality were not here to stay. There wasn't much to worry about the the time; Milky Homles - Alternative were two short specials that, while not executed very well, were still welcome additions to the franchise, presenting a ""what if"" scenario that would've presumably later lead to a third season that's back to what Milky Holmes is really about. 
 
Alas... 
 
""The Age of Detectives. The two flowers, vying for beauty. Their names are the Detective and the Phantom Thief""... if nothing else, this basic setting was retained in Futari wa Milky Holmes, the third season in the franchise, and a canon semi-direct continuation to the second season. As far as the story's concerned, it doesn't exactly connect with the final events of the previous season, but continuity was never really Milky Holmes' strong forte; or rather, it was never all that crucial to proper enjoyment of the show. 
 
Futari, as its name suggests, stars two spunky aspiring Detective lolis. The story revolves around them solving crime (which is apparently detective slang for ""physical violence"" in this show) under a secret identity, incurring the wrath of the local Phantom Thief group, as well as a certain drill-haired police detective. In a way, the existence of new protagonists was the show's initial warning signal, signifying that this might not have been the classic Milky Holmes coveted by its fans. ""Where are the Milky Homles?"" ""Where is G4?"" ""Who are Arsene's breasts?"". Such questions may arise. As previously mentioned, though, change is never necessarily a bad thing. Some modifications of the cast are not nearly enough to bring a show to ruins, much less a franchise... and thankfully, every relevant character from the previous seasons appears in one way or another, but that's a story for another paragraph. For now, let's focus on our protagonists. 
 
Kazumi and Alice, together known as ""The Feathers"", nab the spotlight.  
 
Kazumi has a four-leaf clover hairpin, and Alice wears a nifty hat. In fact, when in their Detective outfits, they BOTH wear pretty nifty hats. 
 
The above description was the absolute most I could do to make them sound interesting. 
 
In a comedy setting, they would be bland. In a ""serious"" setting (which is what Futari is- or rather, strives to be), they would still be bland. Their personalities are mundane. Their attempted character development is miniscule and in the long run meaningless. Their Toys allow for relatively little variety in the combat scenes. They were presumably written to be ""serious"" replacements to the Milky Holmes, much like Alternative's Milky Holmes were ""serious"" replacements to the previous seasons' Milky Holmes. As a side note, seasons 1-2 and even a certain episode of Futari (and the original PSP game, worth noting) proved that it's possible for the Milky Holmes to be competent, powerful leads while still retaining their quirkiness and charm, but it's rarely taken to its full advantage. Instead, we get either Alternative's butchered Milky Holmes who are essentially glorified henchmen for Opera Kobayashi, or The Feathers, who can easily be mistaken for minor one-off characters at best, and cardboard cutouts at worst. That's not to say Futari is without its merits, but a decent chunk of its flaws can be pinned on The Feathers. That said, I gotta give credit where credit is due: the chemistry between the two is for the most part not half bad, as are the conflicts they have between themselves. 
 
The resident rogues gallery, Color the Phantom (or ""Colored Phantoms"", which makes a lot more sense as a name, but that's precisely why I'll stick to the former), is thankfully less banal. Once again, they're not as memorable as the Phantom Thieves Empire, but at this point, that's to be expected. Their designs, however, actually invoke a gentleman thief aura, and their members are diverse and not as predictable as they may initially seem. It would not be an exaggeration to say that they carry the entire plot on their shoulders, for better or for worse. They interact splendidly with The Feathers, and while they're not the best villains in the franchise by a landslide, they're the ones most suited to be The Feathers' rivals... take that as you will. Furthermore, much against all expectations, the story improves tremendously with the introduction of a third party, Visconte. The boundaries between good and evil are blurred, resulting in a more interesting Detective vs. Phantom Thief conflict than the series initially seemed to offer. As far as the lead cast is concerned, the series' strength is with its antagonists. Yet whenever returning characters from previous seasons appear, they serve as a quick snap to the reality that you're watching a show where borderline extras are more interesting characters than the primary protagonists and antagonists, or so they should be, if the previous seasons are an indication. 
 
Apparently, they aren't. To briefly talk about them, the Milky Holmes take on a mentor role in Futari, and each scene with them is marvelously ripe with attempts to make them appear to be the same clumsy bunch that were previously in the spotlight. Their defining character traits are virtually removed, to the point where they can easily be fused into one character under the archetype of ""clumsy Detective mentor girl"" and no one would be any the wiser, nor would their presence in the story be different at all. Kokoro, the grumpy and cocky policewoman, is now reduced to merely ""the grumpy policewoman"". Her mischievously arrogant nature is mostly gone, and in its place, her shtick becomes being moody at anything and everything for little reason. The rest of the G4 are all but absent, save for a handful of scenes. The Phantom Thief Empire's appearances are rather unnecessary- it at times appears as if they were shoved in at the last moment to solidify Futari's connection with the rest of the seasons. None of the recurring characters have any notable bearing on the plot, but with the Phantom Thief Empire, merely their presence as minor characters feels depressingly pointless. 
 
The animation quality and art direction is mostly you'd expect. Nothing jaw-dropping, but definitely solid. Futari actually improves upon its predecessors in that regard, although not by much; the animation rarely falls behind, and the character's facial features (and to a lesser extent their outfits) are overall done better than ever. The voice acting also manages to be solid despite being somewhat amateurish, and the soundtrack is improved overall, with the exception of the barely subpar opening and ending songs. Basically, the production quality is mostly either identical or improved (the episodes themselves are about 10 minutes long, which would normally imply rushed pacing, but this is surprisingly not the case- there are no pacing problems despite the running time constraints), so as expected, what brings it down is the attempt to make Milky Holmes' basic setting work in an excessively serious story. Is it a bad show, though? I wouldn't go that far. As a standalone show unrelated to previous Milky Holmes entries (which nullifies the disappointment factor), it is, in one word, average. Not great, but during its airing time, made for a cute 10-minute distraction. 
 
It should be noted, though, that perhaps the most baffling part about this series' attempt at melodrama and action is how the previous seasons themselves already had some semi-dramatic story branches, and even many impressively well done action scenes. The two aspects which Futari tries its best to succeed in, but to little avail. This is because unlike its predecessors, Futari disregarded any whimsical and over-the-top themes and took itself too seriously for its own good, when Alternative had already proved that it simply wasn't meant to be. The setting of Yokohama definitely allows for stories that are more than just whacky lolis like the Milky Holmes doing funny things, but for it to work successfully, it needs to be approached with the proper mindset; one that's aware of how the Milky Holmes universe is insane enough to gave birth to a character capable of using his erect nipples as swords, and takes advantage of that insanity.

          
 
       Helpful I know that this is effectively going against my rule of reviewing an anime AFTER you've seen it the whole way through, but Futari wa Milky Holmes is an exception. Six episodes in, and there is already so much to say. A lot of disappointment and an unexpected dive south has befallen Milky Holmes. 
 
Can we just forget that Milky Holmes is airing a third season? The original flavor of Milky Holmes thrived in pointless comedy and endless stupidity, effectively creating a series that not only made your face and palm better acquainted, it was actually boatloads of fun to watch. Futari wa Milky Holmes effectively ends the run of the original series with a season that makes sense. How much sense? A whole lot of sense, which it substitutes for all of the airheadedness, all of the moe, and all of the charisma that the first two seasons blessed us with. Why would you ruin a series that was brilliant to begin with, to turn it into something entirely different? And who actually tells the writers that it's okay to fix something that isn't broken? 
 
Story: We are thrust right into a brand-new storyline set two years after the events of Season 2, I think, following two aspiring detectives that are probably the same age as Milky Holmes, who have mysteriously regained their powers. These aspiring detectives decide that they will protect the city from the recent uprising of gentlemen thieves by calling themselves ""The Feathers"". Now, I do not have a problem with the name, as stupid and 8th-grade as it sounds, but I want to address a very important issue: The Feathers actually go out and do things. 
 
I love the pointless nature of Milky Holmes 1 & 2. I love the way they would go out, attempt to do something, and at the end of the day, they would end up merely trying and never achieving their goal as part of the comical impact of the episode. I love the storyline that doesn't seem to move anywhere. In the case of Milky Holmes, it worked and that's all I really hope for. 
 
But now we have two ""successful"" detectives who are capturing villains left and right and the serious tone of the third season as a whole can only hinder the issue further. Suddenly, the story that was originally about random antics day in and day out becomes a story about hope, determination, and struggle. The only other place I ever see that is a sports show. Why is it heading in this direction anyways? 
 
Art: I think this is the only thing that is saving Milky Holmes. As far as the animation goes, it looks more refined and there is a heavier emphasis on powers and the special effects keep the action sequences shining bright, but in the case of a show that has taken a very drastic change for the worst in its sequel, a select few will yearn for the older animation style, to remind them that once upon a time ago, the show that they see before them used to be good. 
 
Character: Milky Holmes makes an appearance as does the rest of Genius 4, even though only Kokoro becomes a regular character. The series is centered on two characters that are so memorable, I don't even remember their names. Not only are they bland, uninteresting, and it is essentially a bore to watch them take the stage, the older characters from the previous seasons change so much, they are beyond recognition. Nero doesn't seem like a tomboy, Cordelia is no longer delusional, Sheryl seems intelligent, and Elly, my favorite of the original protagonists, doesn't seem shy anymore. Is it true that when you regain your toys, you do so by losing a large chunk of your charisma? I'd say so. 
 
And the character that makes this entire show a joy to watch (as if the first two seasons were not already enjoyable enough), probably the most well-known for a 10-hour loop on YouTube, Akechi Kokoro, is not bragging about her 1400+ IQ or panning Milky Holmes for their usual stupidity. Why isn't she? It was comedy gold in the first two seasons and they decided to throw that out as well. 
 
Enjoyment: How can you enjoy watching a show that used to be so great fall from grace and become a show that is so utterly normal, that it's almost unbearable to watch? Maybe for a first-time viewer or a viewer who has had relatively little interest in the Milky Holmes series, it's possible to watch this show with so much as a blank stare, but for an avid fan who enjoyed the original series through-and-through, this third season is like being promised a good thing, only to realize that the promise was no better than getting shot in the foot. It's disappointing. The story has direction which doesn't work with this show and the characters are a shell of their former selves. What's there to like? 
 
Overall: Maybe my excitement got the better of me this time, but for those of you who saw the original two seasons that came before Futari wa Milky Holmes, as much as I want to recommend a NEW Milky Holmes to you, it's not that easy. This season is radically different. It's boring, it does not retain any comedy, and it's really difficult to enjoy. There are 6 episodes left, so hopefully there's something to look forward to within 6 12-minute episodes, but as far as what I've seen, there's no salvaging the old seasons and there's no guarantee that things will even begin to pick up in a more favorable direction.

          
 
       Helpful I discovered this anime by accident and I have to admit that I haven't watched the predecessor, but I'm planning to. Now, I have to say that I expected a 'cute' anime and I got one.  
It was in my opinion going strong sweet and cheesy in the beginning, reminding me a little bit of Disney movies. I liked that and so I was looking forward to the story. 
 
Unfortunately it lost that very soon. The story seemed to streched out and kind of repeated itself, the main characters as well as the side characters got transparent and so ridiculously cliched that at some point I even had to shake my head.  
 
The sweet, cheesy feeling from the beginning was gone and I just had a weak aftertaste after finishing the anime. The compulsive cuteness was not very effective and I could see what happend at the ending a mile away from it. 
 
Such a shame, because it went very good in the beginning. But because of that reasons it's just a decent anime for me.

","For everybody that thinks that if you remove the uselessness of Milky Holmes then the anime would be awesome, I recommend that you think again. 
 
Yes, Milky Holmes were very useful in this ""alternative"" universe but the cost was far too great. There were less laughs and random stupidity in this series. I felt like I was watching something different. While watching this, I realized that Milky Holmes isn't complete without Kokoro-chan shouting her usual catchphrase of ""Don't call me Kokoro-chan"" and Henriette Mystere with her big ""boing-boing"". 
 
Okay so I spoiled you a bit. Yes, there's no appearance (hell, there's no room) for Kokoro-chan nor Henriette here so for their fans, you'll get disappointed if you watch this because of the lack of screen time for them. 
 
What can I say about the story is so far, this is the best plot line I've ever seen for Milky Holmes. I recommend that you understand the story again and again. It's like Milky Holmes meets Detective Conan's hard to solve cases. 
 
Conclusion, if you remove Milky Holmes' uselessness, you'll get much, much more uselessness. Then again, if you really are a big fan of Milky Holmes, you should watch this just so you could add this to your anime list.

          
 
       Helpful For those of you who watched the first two seasons of Milky Holmes, and then decided, ""I have had enough moe comedy, I don't want to watch the Alternatives."" Watch the Alternative. These two episodes are the 180 of Milky Holmes. It shows what would have happened if they had never lost their Toys. Honestly, if this is what Milky Holmes was, it would would probably be one of my favorites.  
 
Milky Holmes goes to London to visit their old teacher Opera Kobayashi. Except instead of being useless, they are well on their way to becoming full fledged detectives. There is more plot than comedy, but the comedy is still as slapstick as ever. They meet Adler and the british version of Kokoro. Together, they must recover five mysterious paintings and unlock their secret.  
 
The Alternatives are more serious than the anime, and lack Arsene, Phantom Thief empire, and G4. However it is still really good. The story is a little under developed since it only had two episodes, but is really good. If you want to see what Milky Holmes would be if they weren't stupid, useless, idiots, this is the anime to watch!

          
 
       Helpful Tantei Opera Milky Holmes was a series that caught me by surprise with its eccentric characters and ridiculous humor. This special, however, is Milky Holmes devoid of the charm that made the original series so enjoyable.  
 
Imagine if the Milky Holmes detectives were actually competent and solved real mysteries. That＊s what you＊ll get in this alternative episode. In short, the four Milky Holmes girls solve a mystery in London with the help of their mentor, Kobayashi Opera. Sounds like a recipe for a good bit of fun, right? 
 
Well, not really. The episode is, in a word, dull. The girls＊ new competence is a double-edged sword: while it is interesting to see Milky Holmes using their toys properly for the first time, the humor that accompanies their usual clumsiness and air headedness becomes absent. The mystery is also nothing to write home about; it＊s not especially clever and is typical Saturday morning cartoon kind of fare.  
 
The art is what you＊d expect for Tantei Opera Milky Holmes: colorful and cutesy. The animation is decent but has noticeably less energy than that of the original series. The music, including the new ending song, is forgettable.  
 
All in all, this is a very subdued, tamed version of Milky Holmes, lacking the wackiness and humor of the earlier seasons. If you are a fan of the series, you might want to watch this just to see Kobayashi, who makes his first real anime appearance here, but there＊s not much more to see here beyond that. For newcomers, this special can be readily watched without seeing the parent series, but I would highly recommend watching the original series first to get more familiarity and attachment with the characters.

The HW series was designed to be a weapon designed for the military, this is in contrast to the BW series weapon, which is glass-based and causes targets to become glass for a brief moment before bursting into flames.
","＃you are walking down through the foggy wet night of an old badly lit neighborhood when you suddenly spot a humming neon sign on top of a brick thorn wall with a small wooden door by it. Walking steadily towards it the echoed water splashing sound caused by your steps against the water on the pavement,  give place to a still stuffy mellow deep bass from inside the place. As soon as you open the door your eyes instantly loose themselves on the tick mist of smoke against the small green lamps on each table, which provides the only light to the small cramped room. Your ears get absorbed by the slow jam so loud now that even your thoughts are difficult to reach, and your nose goes numb with the strong stench of smoke, alcohol and a faint scent of gunpowder.  All your senses seem to plead you to turn back and go away, but by the time the neural impulse reaches your fingers they had already let go of the door. 
 
On the left you spot a long dirty bar filled with broken dreams and misleading smiles on the small uncomfortable sits. A few steps where enough before the almost faded green light behind the gorgeous mistress holding a glass and inviting you to sit by her, made the blurry whisky glasses by the counter shine like stars on an empty night sky. By now you are fully aware, neither bullets nor kisses will save you, and if the green girl on the other side of the room screaming as she burns inside a huge pyre, or the two teenage girls playing with a dog casually right by her are any indication, it＊s obvious what awaits you＃ 
 
So, in a nutshell, this is what you should expect out of Crystal Blaze＃ outside the fact that this is not how the story goes. Obviously, if you are keen on specifics or my mental image simply left you absolutely clueless, please, feel free to keep reading, I will do my best to refrain from further insanity. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Story & Characters 
 
If you are looking for cross-references there are a few, Heat Guy J, Speed Grapher and Cowboy Bebop amongst others. These come pretty close to this title in terms of development and overall feeling, with some going a bit further sharing more similarities than others. Being even remotely familiar with the genre, there is nothing out of the ordinary to be expected from Crystal Blaze. From the very first episode all the twists become obvious and the small remaining margin for originality is never reached. 
 
Predictive as it is, this is not the major issue here. The usual beat down story of mad scientist making ultimate weapon is all there with everything that comes to be expected for such an uninspired theme, but what really hurts is the lack of urgency. One might come to Crystal Blaze expecting a thriller of some sort, but the murders we are presented to are tedious and mostly at random, the conspiracy that the plot revolves around is dull and consists of nameless entities that are nothing more than extremely convenient plot devices, and the thrive to unveil the mysteries is never interesting on its own. 
 
The characters themselves simply put are shallow. They are somewhat well designed and seem to be interesting, but with their past never being explained thoroughly, and the interactions they go through mostly forced, we end up with badly developed arcs and difficulty to relate to their plight as consequence. This is not to say they are bad since they do play exclusively by their strengths, never trying to get out of character or doing anything not to be expected from the default role they are occupying. You, as well as I did, might end up relating to one or another based on premises and expectations alone, just don＊t think they will be fully delivered by the time the curtain closes. 
  
------------------------------------------ 
Animation, Art & Sound 
 
Such is the case with such anime, as ironic as it may sound, animation it not its strongest point. All in all, despite somewhat insipid the animation does hold itself well under scrutiny for the most part, but its less than stellar quality does show some problems when the script requires over the top sequences. On the stances where we get past the somewhat awkwardly staged gunfights, with people running straight at gunshots with disregard for their own safety, and bullets making miraculous trajectories to avoid life threatening wounds, the animation is not extremely fluid, but since these are rare enough it don＊t get in the way of the enjoyment.  
 
The art is just fine, with well designed characters containing a fair amount of detail and personality, particularly the females that are gorgeous, and thankfully so since the male characters do nothing more than fill the basic traits for their roles, even if well executed. The color pallet seemed a little off putting for me from time to time, but the background is also competent and not overly used, making the city seems fairly lively and diverse. 
 
Opening and ending themes are good and add a crucial vibe to the whole production. The background music is very competent presenting itself unobtrusively, coming off on the right moments and setting the mood while not aspiring for the spotlight. Stepping outside the music arrangements, the sound effects feel authentic without ever going too over the top, and the voice actors do a remarkably good job giving an extra tinge of originality to their characters. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Value/Enjoyment & Conclusion 
 
Whatever reasons someone might have to start watching a series, be it the advertisement surrounding it, be it interest in the plot, be it a friend＊s recommendation or simply out of curiosity, one thing is certain, a much greater effort is necessary to put it away after you got sucked into the plot and started to relate to the characters. 
 
Being the average anime it is, after you get into the plot, albeit not an incredibly interesting one, after you get to know the characters, albeit not particularly well developed ones, after you get into the mood of the show, albeit not very climatic one＃ well, after you get yourself into the trap it won＊t present you any major flaw to break away the immersion.  
 
What this particularly pessimistic painting of the twelve episode series is trying to present itself as, is simply that Crystal Blaze comes pretty clear with its premises, and even while not reaching out for anything beyond that, for fans of this specific type of anime or people just interested by its plot, characters or setting, I can＊t build a strong enough case not to recommend it. Even if it won＊t take the center spot into anyone＊s shelf, it can be a valiant effort into giving one some diversity, just drop your high expectations outside the room before you give it a shot. 


          
 
       Helpful What can one expect out of a pure action/sci-fi, such as we have here in Cystal Blaze? Good fights, interesting technologies, and the same things we've come to expect out of basically any anime: good characters, plot, and in some cases, a great soundtrack.  With these as our guidelines, how effective is Crystal Blaze at presenting its story and themes? Well, like attempting to use Earthquake on a Flying-type Pokemon, its not effective at all, except under very specific circumstances.  
 
Let's start off with the basics in what Crystal Blaze does well. Its not all that much, but if you're looking for something with action, you can probably enjoy this series.  Don't misunderstand me though, for this is not the pinnacle of Action Mountain.  For a huge fan of such a series, Crystal Blaze is an adequate anime. Its one that you'd be able to spend your time on without thinking afterwards that you'd have been better off throwing your time down the garbage disposal.  Its soundtrack isn't exactly stellar, but it gets the job done without actively detracting from the events that are unfolding.  While not commendable, it does what its supposed to do and doesn't get in the way, so it's impossible to fault it there. The story with the animation is much of the same.  
 
This, however, is where the praises must end, for Crystal Blaze does not warrant any more positive feedback than its already received. Other than its okay action sequences and passable soundtrack and animation, Crystal Blaze doesn't have much else going for it.  Primary amongst these faults is, unfortunately, the plot. In regards to both its Sci-Fi aspect and its general storytelling aspect, Crystal Blaze falls flatter than the paper the storyboards were written on.  Folks looking for a decent Sci-Fi should look further, as even this primary building block of the series fell into poor management.  The secrets that the viewer wonders about since the beginning of the series are never properly answered, save a few vague ""explanations"" that only really serve to add more questions to the blazing fire that is the viewer's curiosity.  
 
 The characters are, somehow, even more mismanaged than these facets.  Here, we have ""Rags Town"", a place where people go to forget their pasts. One expecting well-developed characters with strong backstories should turn away and run now, or otherwise attempt to tackle this monstrosity.  With such a setting in ""Rags Town"", Crystal Blaze is perfectly set up to give not one, but all of its characters wonderfully moving or tragic backstories--and can be, in a way, expected to do so.  What motivates these people? Why are the here, and why do they stay? In the end...we never know.  Any such backstory is shoved into one montage at the end of a middle episode, and even then, it only really gives a basic, barebones backstory for one character.  Even with such a setting, Crystal Blaze proceeds to completely abandon any promise for developing its characters, leaving them as action-character stereotypes to further along its weak, cliche-filled plotline.   
 
So in the end, is it worth watching Crystal Blaze? The hard truth is...probably not.  If you're a fan of action series in general, you could give this a shot and you may find it entertaining.  Its not a gem, but you may enjoy it.  If you're just looking for a quality, well-made anime with strong core elements, I'm afraid you'll need to keep looking.  Overall, its not a complete loss if its got exactly what you're looking for...but don't expect to be blown away.

          
 
       Helpful 1)Intro/Synopsis 
Rags Town is the garbage dump of Japan. The place where people who want to forget their pasts run to. In this town, where the rules strictly forbid asking about the past or getting to know people, there is small detective agency called S&A Detectives.  
The story revolves around Ayamana, the inseparable pair of misfit wannabe detectives, the case Manami takes on impulse, and the trouble that arises from it. On the case they find a woman who is abnormally hot, and who is being chased by a bunch of women with guns. After being dubbed Sara, the detectives try and figure out just what is going on with her. At the same time, all over town teenage girls are burning up and turning into glass. The government is covering everything up, but the detectives, as well as a nosy reporter and the local police, are determined to find out what is happening. 
 
2)Plot 
Crystal Blaze follows the story of Sara, a young woman who＊s being pursued by an evil organization.  This is just the beginning of the cliches folks, I hope your prepared.  What＊s the twist, then?  She＊s a biological superweapon capable of localized devastation and nearly invulnerable to attack.  Despite that, she＊s still just a perfectly nice girl that wants to live her life.  She ends up in the protection of a detective agency, and naturally the two groups start trying to outmaneuver each other.  In the process, they discover a huge coverup and factory to produce these weapons, including an even more powerful weapon 
 
3)Characters 
Sara aka HW9 is a Nice Character with a good amount of character development as the entire plot mainly focuses upon her.Like Sara, the rest of the cast is pretty much a bunch of stock characters.  Shu is the main protagonist of the story, he＊s a ladies man who＊s quite aloof and only concerned about conducting his business.I really like Shu coz he is Charizmatic and exudes Style and Precision in his actions throughout the Anime.  Akira, his brother, is the nice guy that does most of the footwork for the agency as well as the House Chores.  Manami is a high energy tomboy who will honestly grate on your nerves a bit in just a few episodes and she has secured a place in my Top 5 Most annoying Anime characters.  Ayaka is the exact opposite, she＊s very quiet and withdrawn.  Porilynn is Shu＊s cross-dressing boss who has his thumb over the pulse of the town through an immense security camera network.He is one of the Main attractions among the Cast,a good friend of Shu and offers a nice Comic relief.Sophia,a Crime reporter cum journalist is definitely one of the best characters in the anime who gives an emotional perspective to the storyline.  And finally there＊s Sensei and Monica, the lecherous doctor and his assistant. 
 
4)Animation 
The animation is Pretty good and all the characters are well drawn but need a little Getting Used To kinda feel..The backgrounds are decently detailed and this is all we would expect from this kind of series. 
 
5)Choreography 
The overall choreography is incredibly well done But I felt that the direction in some of the show's more fast-paced scenes could use some tightening up. There's nothing more annoying than a gunfight where everything pauses for a key exchange of dialogue, and you're left wondering why the rest of the participants should have suddenly decided to hold still and stop shooting. 
 
6)Music-Op and Ed 
The music really deserves a little Praise here and Succeeds in successfully capturing the Mystery cum Suspense vibe throughout the Anime. 
I really enjoyed the Opening video song very much. 
 
7)Perks(A word Coined by Me to indicate all the Out of the Box strategies the Animation Studios use to attract the Viewers such as Fanservice,and use of References from famous Anime). 
Shuu, the head of the detective agency, may not be a conscious homage to Ryo Saeba from City Hunter, but it has to be said that there's a haunting resemblance. Both of them earn their living as freelance tough guys, they both carry huge revolvers, and they both go through women like popcorn. Shuu even drives a classic '80s car.There is very minimal fanservice and far from being called Ecchi. 
 
8)Final verdict 
So with all these cliches, this series must be absolutely horrible, right?  Well, not quite.  The story follows a fairly predictable course of events, but there＊s little moments of surprise that managed to make me rewind and look at th scene again.  All of the characters grow to a decent degree by the end of the series, except for Manami, who is eternally annoying as sin.  The balance of action and story filler is pretty decent, I never felt like the series was dragging, nor running too fast, which is pretty good for a 12 episode series.  And, well, it＊s just entertaining, and sometimes that＊s what matters. pretty well paced out right up until the end were it seemed a bit to rushed so I didn't really care for that but at least it easily tied up all the loose ends up rather nicely into one little episode. It's no Black Lagoon but it is a decent detective/scifi show that tosses in a little fanservice and a little dark humor 
The bottom line, is Crystal Blaze is just decent; you can tell they were trying to do something here but just fell short.  It＊s definitely not a series that breaks new ground, but it does have little glimmers of greatness.  The art style feels a little awkward at first, but it grows on you.  As the series progresses, it naturally gets darker to match the overall tone of the story.  And as I mentioned before, I waited three months for the conclusion.  So if you＊ve got the time, give it a chance.

An arranged accident leaves Rera and Ranma in an unfortunate state where the two detectives swap bodies at the stroke of midnight. With Ranma dissapearing and the beautiful Rera appearing.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"If you ever wanted to see a more romantic team up of Lupin & Fujiko, then this anime is the closest you＊re gonna get. 
 
Cinderella Boy is sort of a mix of Lupin the 3rd, Birdy the Mighty, Baron Ashura & Ranma 1/2. From Monkey Punch, the creator of Lupin the 3rd , brings a really odd idea for a story. Originally made as a one shot manga in 1980, Cinderella boy is about a pair of private detectives; Ranma & Rella. What makes it akin to Lupin are the obvious character designs and the similarities stop there. The characters don＊t have much in common with the familiar Fujiko & Lupin outside of appearances.  
 
The main story is these two botched a job & are in a car accident. A mysterious scientist operates on them; fusing them together. And this is where the other comparisons come in. Following the story of Cinderella when the clock strikes 12 they switch bodies & have no memory of the other person＊s activities. Obviously, this means a lot of awkward situations during the sudden strike at midnight hence the Ranma ? similarities, especially when certain characters have crushes.  
 
The anime is 13 episodes long each focusing on different jobs but the pair Ranma & Rella have enough energy to make even the simplest of cases very entertaining. There＊s an ongoing mystery as we do learn who operated on them and why. A organization is involved creating legitimate intrigue in its sci-fi undertones of the final episodes. It＊s very interesting how it evolved from a detective story. The 13 episodes do work well in keeping me engaged to the story & once again it＊s mostly because of the characters.  
 
Ranma Hinamatsuri is a good guy with a big heart & passion for justice. His hobbies include collecting classy toy car models & has a fear of heights. Despite looking like a brown jacket Lupin, Ranma isn＊t really a professional but he manages to get the job done. It＊s his unpolished skills that made things really funny for me. Rella Cindy Shirayuki kind of steals the show. Both Ranma & Rella do have their share of dramatic episodes but Rella has a more assertive yet selfish personality. Actually, Rella has a bigger backstory themed episode than Ranma. She＊s very motivated & easily angry allowing for a lot of energy in her scenes. Rella is a rich girl and her maid creates multiple gadgets for the ongoing episodes. Despite being wealthy, Rella seeks thrills but isn＊t as heroic as Ranma. I wish there was more flashbacks or episodes where we got to see both of them together but given the plot of sharing a single body it＊s an impossibility. Rella is the life of the party while Ranma offers a more comical approach to the series.  
 
Cinderella boy manages to create it＊s own underworld in Kirin Town with some recurring characters. It＊s not very clear if this city has advanced technology such as flaying cars or this was just a clever way to save budget by not drawing tires but whatever I＊m cool with that. Cinderella boy is the type of show aimed at fans of odd job agency anime. Series like City Hunter, Get Backers, Hurricane Polymer, & Gintama, etc. Meaning comedic adventures or some serious story lines. There isn＊t much action then again this is a 2003 anime. Something about the mid 2000's seems to be a transition phase before the world went to hd as many anime around this time would experiment with some early CGI and the colors could range from looking kinda ugly to very pretty. The animation is also very＃ stiff in the early episodes but the rest of the series did show better mobility as it kept going. Episode 6 is the animation standout of the bunch as it was the 1st episode I noticed improvements and utilized a lot of fast paced action mixed in with the occasional colorful backgrounds. What I＊m trying to get is the anime looks better as it reaches the ending but the early stuff does appear rough. I assume this is why a lot of attention was put into the characters and the writing since the animation wouldn＊t be able to deliver outstanding work.  
 
The short stories are well told playing on Ranma & Rella emotions towards their clients and being intimate with each other. It＊s a very strange yet almost sad relationship as they can＊t see or interact with one another except via recorded messages. I was really into the start of the anime as we saw how Ranma & Rella reacted to their partners supposed death only to find out they＊re alive but I can＊t see him or I can＊t see her. There＊s definitely some romantic tension but I wished we saw a little more of this. The anime manages to have some tragic episodes mixed in with the goofy antics of monkey punch. There＊s not really anything too perverted in the anime but there＊s a few topless scenes in the beginning. I＊m assuming the show couldn＊t keep doing that as the nudity vanishes in later episodes.  
 
In a way, Cinderella boy could also give an insight to how a Lupin the 8th anime would be like had it fully existed but for what we got Cinderella Boy is worth watching.

One night while breaking in to a Mafia Boss casino and being chased down a broken highway road they get into a accident which changes their lives. Dr. Grimm who find them uses their bodies has a experiment for his future idea of saving the earth. Thus both Rama & Rella are unified in one body & at the stroke of midnight one will vanish and the other will takeover. Viewers will witness the history and relationship of Ranma & Rella while they go on there new found journey. If you like the feel of Lupin & Cowboy Bebop(similar character designs) you enjoy this anime. This also has a mature sexiness/ comedy to it. Wish there was a season two with the cliffhanger that was left behind. If you are looking for a quick enjoyable anime to pass time you will enjoy this.

One thing I really liked about this movie is how Conan and Kid interacted, even if they are rivals, the synergy was perfect, they complemented each other when it needed.  
Another point I would like to address is when Conan explained to Kid how the murders occurred,  like using some kind of hologram,  the whole scene was something I would like to see in the TV Series as well.

       Helpful Detective Conan, a masterpiece. I've been watching this anime for more than 12 years. Every single movie has an outstanding story as well as the animation. This particular one was very well put out. I would  100% recommend it. I'm sure you will enjoy it as well, although I don't like many many animes this one is one that I will never dislike. I have been waiting for Katou Kid to appear once again, and this was a nice appearance. So much suspense and makes you jump out of excitement. You also start to suspect everyone but of course it'll always be the one you never would have thought it would be. Enjoyed this movie a lot. Hopefully you guys will too!Overall great movie!

When it comes to seriousness, you can forget because the producers of this anime know no such word. Just as the anime's title suggests, I had never watched such a random show. But, in this case, that's completely irrelevant because it isn't meant to be anything more than that: just utter randomness that makes you laugh almost constantly. 
 
As this anime focus on pure and fast comedy (and being the episodes 3 minutes long) there is no room for a story what-so-ever. The same goes for character development; the only thing that stands out in each character is their unique way of speaking, their jokes and their comments. 
 
The art is good and colorful, but nothing extraordinary. It is totally enough for this kind of anime. 
 
As for the soundtrack, it is nothing special and, just like the art, it is suitable to the show. 
 
Since this anime focuses only on comedy, enjoyment is pretty much guaranteed, but don't get your expectations too high 'cause you might end up disappointed. Yes, Strange+ is hillarious, however it depends on the person's mood. If you're ready to watch something so incoherent and senseless, then you will like it. 
 
Well, I think this is a simple and yet different anime that will bring you lots of senseless situations along with tons of laughs. I guess this is the kind of anime to be watched just for fun, without thinking too much about what's happening, because the main plot is that there is no plot, and the main and only point is to laugh to tears. 
As it is really short, time issues shouldn't be a problem, so just watch one episode every once in a while just to chill out and crack up :D

This anime truly is a blast for all comedy fans. I enjoy their parody's of other detective or action animes, but if it would be just that, I wouldn't love this show so much. Strange+ has a lot more to offer, yes it's a funny, silly gag anime, but at the same it's their amazing main characters (who always make everything worse), that make this show unique, ridiculous and hilarious! Most of the time, you have no idea what the hell is going on, things just happen, but it's fine, because the show delivers, it's full of surprises, references to really old animes and weird twists, introducing new characters like it's nothing, explosions, random weapons, magic, ""traditional traps"", villains who disguise themselves as maids, what ever, you name it, this show has it, it doesn't have to make sense, it always makes me laugh -  the WTF moments are pure gold and the characters reactions to them as well. To me it's never too much, because the episodes are only about 4 minutes long, so you can watch the entire season in less than one hour. Short animes FTW! 
 
Plot: Never mind 
 
Characters: Oh man...how do I even begin? In this strange world there are 4 strange detectives, Takumi - a very confident attention loving bishonen blue haired boy who likes to cross dress, and the 'boss' of the detective agency they all work at, K身 - his younger brother (although he looks like the big brother), who is nothing like him, he's probably the least strange character - every gag anime needs a 'straight' guy, then there is Masamune, the strong, for some reason African looking, guy who you would accept to save the day, but like everyone else, is not as competent as you might wish and last but not least a female character, eye-candy Miwa, who's loyal, weird and super hot but that is mostly ignored. Then there's a bunch of side characters (villains/allies) that make the show go round, sometimes they appear once and then never again, sometimes they return by just popping out of nowhere to take revenge or something, who really cares? It's hilarious. 
 
 
I'm glad to hear that there will be a second season! I want to watch much more of this this really strange anime, although the art is nothing special the voice actors did a great job :) I had a lot of fun with it so I gave a very high rating.  (I could list some great quotes from the show lol, but it's so much funnier if you just watch it yourself)

16,7768,9,8.762767398,Detective and his or her helper,Tantei Opera Milky Holmes,"""Toys"" are powers bestowed upon those chosen to wield them, each having qualities that are unique to their users. Some of these individuals are born pure, using their powers to become detectives. Others bloom laced with poison and choose to become phantom thieves. These two opposing factions caused the formation of various detective academies around the globe〞training detectives to fight and catch the phantom thieves. 
 
Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Burton, and Cordelia Glauca form ""Milky Holmes"", a group recognized as the cream of the crop in the Yokohama-based Holmes Detective Academy. However, in a skirmish against the phantom thief Arsene, their Toys suddenly disappear, deeming them unfit to continue as detectives. Stripped of their prestigious life and thrown into a rundown attic, they face expulsion if they fail to regain their powers within the next three months. 
 
 Tantei Opera Milky Holmes  tells the story of a once-legendary group in their journey to recover their Toys, as well as attempting to continue their line of work without the powers that once defined their career. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Super Power']","Set in the near future in the Great Era of Detectives, chosen people are born with supernatural abilities known as Toys (玄奶朮, Toizu). Those who use these Toys for evil are responsible for a wave of crimes and necessitate employing Toy-using detectives to help solve them. In the Yokohama District, Opera Kobayashi runs a detective agency named Milky Holmes, made up of four budding young detectives, Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Barton and Cordelia Glauca, who each wield their own unique toys and train to become detectives at Holmes Detective Academy.
The video game casts players in the role of Kobayashi, who must utilise Milky Holmes' unique abilities to stop the Thieves' Empire, a band of thieves led by the mysterious Ars谷ne. The second puts players in the role of another detective, Ellery Himeyuri. The Alternative TV specials also take place in this universe, in which Kobayashi and Milky Holmes are assisted by another Toy user, Lily Adler, in fighting against the Thieves' Empire whilst visiting London.
In the first two anime television series, the four girls of Milky Holmes, Sherlock, Nero, Hercule and Cordelia, end up losing their Toys during an encounter with the Thieves' Empire. Taken away from their rich lifestyle and thrown into an attic, the girls must try to regain use of their Toys or else face expulsion from Holmes Detective Academy. Futari wa Milky Holmes, which takes place two years after the other series, follows two young girls, Alice and Kazumi, who, inspired by Milky Holmes, form their own detective unit, Feathers, and fight against a group of thieves known as the Color the Phantom. Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.
","I'm honestly not sure what else to start with other than that I came to this show with expectations that I could watch lolies go on wacky adventures and solve strange cases. At the start I am greeted to the protagonists and the antagonists. The first five minutes prove to be very promising, with the characters losing their powers. I figured that they would have to use teamwork to move forward. What I got after that though was highly disappointing.  
 
I'm going to be straight with you, one of things that got me through the first few episodes was the lolies, and even then, they weren't much on their own. I got the feeling that the creators thought that making the girls borderline retarded would make them more cute, sort of like the girls in K-on, mainly Yui. But the difference between the two casts is that at least the girls in K-on get good at what the set out to do. Yui get to be a good guitar player, and even though she acts it, she does get good grades when she puts her mind to it. The cast of Milky Holmes never really improved. At first I was appalled at the amount of discrimination the girls got simply for losing their powers. Those that lose their powers are called ""useless"", and Milky Holmes was no exception. Supposedly the girls were famous and had solved many cases, but once their powers were lost, they were treated lower than dirt. I still held similar sentiments throughout the show, because they were expected to get their toys back when it was never proven that anybody had ever done that before. But most of it left because the girls really did tend to be useless, they hindered far more than helped.  
 
And this show really doesn't have a villain. This show is supposed to be lighthearted. We learn in the first episode that the Student Council President is Arsene, and her three henchmen have also all infiltraded the girl's school. One is a teacher, one a chef, and the other a fellow student. I will repeat this show really doesn't have a villain. To be honest, the ""villains"" were more interesting than the girls. I would guess Arsene enjoys the chase more than victory, because several of her plots are to help the girls get their powers and deep down she seems to have a good heart. Twenty, the teacher, is narcissistic to the point he carries around a dakimakura (hugging pillow) with himself on it.The chef dude (who's name eludes me) is usually serious, but he too tends to provide some comedy, and Rat, the student acts like a rival at times to the girls. The villains remind me a lot of Team Rocket. I felt that they were doing most of the work for making the show enjoyable. 
 
Speaking of enjoyment, I felt the first few episodes were poor, but it picked up in comedy after that, only to get more serious later on. This tended to create a clash I felt. As the story got more serious, the characters didn't really follow suit. I understand that if it had the girls would have seemed too different, but I felt as it was, they stood out and got in the way. The tone in the later episodes I felt didn't really work with the characters. The midsection of the series was definitely the best of them. 
 
I get that the show is suppose to be a parody of the detective genre, I think a parody itself would work, but what I got wasn't so much a parody of the detective genre, and more of k-on where the girls are supposed to be detectives. And it's a k-on where they suck at their job from beginning to end. At least the villains aren't so bad, otherwise the people would be doomed. 
 
The most memorable character and my favorite is Twenty. I really wanted it to be one of the lolies, but my favorite loli of the show, Irene, wasn't featured enough. Twenties antics just really stuck out, even amongst the other strange happenings from the cast. Like when he licked his dakimakura of himself, or when he frequently stripped in class, or best of all, one of his lines in episode 3. He was the star of the show if you ask me.

          
 
       Helpful When watching the first episode my first impression was that this anime was a children's anime on detectives and thief's, oh but how i was wrong. After watching more episodes i find that this series is definitely for older audiences especially when the teacher made his appearance.  
 
Story: 5/10 
Whilst their is a plot half of the episodes are dedicated to pure randomness, this is to be expected of from a comedy series. Now to the main story line. This story revolves Sherlock and her friends and their mission to re-gain/ find their toys whilst also trying to arrest The Gentleman Thief Empire. This is a plot that hasn't got much to it except that.  
 
Art: 8/10 
I enjoyed the art style used for this anime. I like how each character is drawn and how they animated the some of the battle scenes. The background was nothing out of the ordinary which was a little disappointing but the character design made up for it. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
I did like the choice of the theme music since I thought it fitted quite well with the story. My reason for saying that is because the opening (i think) was sung by the seiyuu's of the main four characters whilst the ending represented Lady Arsene in a way. 
 
Character: 7/10 
Each character had their well known personalities from Hercule and her shyness to Mr. Nijuuri who loves himself. Each character is definitely unique in their own way and great to watch. 
 
Enjoyment: 6/10 
This series was hilarious at most times, whilst at other times it bugged me especially whenever the episode revolved around Kokoro Akechi, she really bugged me because all she did was pull pranks on Milky Holmes that I didn't really find funny.  
 
Overall: 8/10 
This is a great series to add to your list since it is packed with a great amount of comedy. It was fun to watch and it had a great art style too. If you are the type who likes to watch anime where they're serious about the plot then i wouldn't recommend this to you since they love to joke around in this series alot. Overall a fantastic series.

          
 
       Helpful After ranting like crazy about the first episode when I first saw it, I never thought I would go back to finish the rest of it. But after hearing that it was nominated by Japanese fans as the best anime of 2010 (although Japanese fans do admittingly have some odd tastes in anime＃) and hearing some good comments about it from the few people I knew that were watching the show, I figured going back and finishing the show couldn＊t hurt. And I can say that, after watching this series, while it is the most underrated from the Fall season of 2010, it is by no means the best of the year. For a comedy, it was actually done rather well, and while it gets heavy in fanservice sometimes, this show turned out surprisingly better than I had expected. 
 
That being said, the key thing you need to realize when approaching this anime is that it＊s pretty much just a huge parody about everything it touches upon. It parodies the detective-phantom thief dynamic (which Detective Conan is famous for), along with a ton of random jokes and video game parodies. I＊ll admit that I didn＊t get all the jokes, but the ones that I did understand were hilarious, or at least brought a smile to my face. If you start watching this show expecting anything other than slapstick comedy, be warned, you won＊t find this show particularly enjoyable. 
 
One thing I did notice about some of the jokes, though, is that while some of the jokes were loaded with moe and cute laughter, the implications of the joke were actually quite a bit more serious. For example, when I saw that the main cast was OVERJOYED to be thrown into jail so that they could get a free meal, while the moment was funny I also thought ※man, did they seriously just become happy by being thrown in jail?§. This happens quite a few times, such as when the starving, desperate protagonists decided to grill mushrooms that they harvested from the underside of their old, decrepit desk, so on so forth. I guess you could say that I was surprised by how there a few more serious implications to certain scenes than you would think for a moe comedy show. I don＊t think this was done on purpose, but it＊s still an interesting little thing to note. 
 
The main cast was a total mess, though I do think it was done that way on purpose. The story follows a group of four girls that have aspirations of becoming great detectives, but when they lose their superpowers (termed ※toys§ in this show), they become utterly useless. Like, seriously, they were probably the most incompetent, simple-minded, spoiled main cast I＊ve seen in a long time. 
 
Spoiled in the sense that the main characters had become almost completely incompetent after they lost their powers, which just shows how over reliant they were on those powers. However, these negative traits were often used to comedic effect, which I thought was an interesting way to go about things. Some of the characters, although extremely lacking in any sort of proper character development, turned out rather charming to watch and got laughs out of me. 
 
The main story got rather repetitive quite a bit, but the main strength with the story was probably how it was executed. The story certainly tried to put some unconventional twists into whatever was happening, and while it wasn＊t always successful, it was still quite good at keeping the viewer engaged in the happenings of the show. The pure ridiculousness of the events in the show, along with how this show never tries to really take itself seriously (as opposed to some often forced drama in other comedies), works out surprisingly better than I had thought it would. 
 
What was a bigger issue in this series was probably the production quality, which was very weak in the first episode, and mediocre throughout the rest of the series. Tantei Opera certainly will not be winning any sort of best animation awards, but JC staff still managed to pull through in the end. 
 
Overall, Tantei Opera was surprisingly better than expected, and did exactly what the creators meant to do; create a slapstick comedy with some absurd situations and characters, and nothing really beyond that. While I certainly don＊t think this was the best comedy by any means, it certainly had a more unique execution with a bunch of it＊s jokes. I can see why people say this is the most underrated show from Fall 2010 outside of Japan. While this show certainly isn＊t for everybody, and the fanservice may turn some people off from this show, Tantei Opera has it＊s own merits and strengths that make it a rather entertaining show in it＊s own right. 
 
Production Quality: 7.5/10 
 
Characters: 8.0/10 
 
Story: 7.5/10 
 
Setting: 7.0/10 
 
Overall Enjoyment: 7.5/10 (Rounded up to a 8 on MAL)

Do you know how to make animation? Everybody wants to see the workings of an animation studio.

(The actual animation is also involved in this special.) 
 
(Source: TMS Entertainment, LTD)","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']",none,"Aoyama Goshou is best-known for ＆Meitantei Conan＊, a detective manga series that already spans over 17 years of serialization with more years to come. But his magnum opus didn＊t come out of nothing 每 for years, Aoyama experimented with his drawing style and storytelling techniques in order to create a most successful combination. We can see that in Magic Kaito and Yaiba 每 but Goshou is also responsible for a set of short stories that he made during his first years as a mangaka. And here we have an adaptation of these short stories 每 ＆Aoyama Goshou Tanpenshuu＊. 
 
As the title suggests, it is a set of standalone different episodes that illustrate Aoyama＊s work. The episodes vary in length considerably 每 from a 7-minute shorts (mostly ＆Detective Conan＊-related) to 30-minute episodes with a complete storyline and no direct connection to DC. But even while watching episodes that have seemingly no relation to Conan, you can＊t help noticing multiple similarities. 
 
And that is, in my opinion, the most interesting thing about this title 每 we have an opportunity to see the creative process of mangaka, how various ideas were born in Aoyama＊s head and later successfully implemented into DC. For example, we get to see a little, but at the same time adult detective in one of the short stories. The idea of a character waiting for his beloved one because of her mysterious disappearance (in DC, it＊s the other way around) also originates from Aoyama＊s earlier work and it＊s also adapted here. The concept of suddenly becoming much younger can be found in one of the stories, too. 
 
The same voice cast(only in different roles), soundtrack by Katsuo Ohno and easily recognizable Aoyama＊s style turned into animation by TMS Entertainment 每 all these facts strongly suggest that it is a DC special, though most stories don＊t feature Conan at all. 
 
And so, the question arises 每 ＆Does this title have any value by itself?＊ My answer is 每 yes, but not too much. The stories themselves are nice and well-made (one is even based on an award-winning one shot), but that＊s all 每 I wouldn＊t call them outstanding. You still may like it neverthealess, even if you are not familiar with Aoyama＊s works. 
 
But in order to fully enjoy ＆Aoyama Goshou Tanpenshuu＊, you must at least know what DC is about 每 simply to understand all the connections between them. This is, in my opinion, how a special should be done 每 considerably long, well-drawn, with a meaningful story that adds something to the main title (not the 2-minute flash animations that don＊t have anything except fanservice and bad attempts at humor). Others(not familiar with DC) may not enjoy it much, but this title can also be seen as a good DC introduction 每 imagine ＆Aoyama Goshou Tanpenshuu＊ in a more detective-like manner and you will find out if DC is for you or not. 
 
Overall, it＊s an excellent special, a true present to DC fans. If you consider yourself to be one and by any chance missed this title, watch it as soon as you can. And if you do, you will see the world DC universe came from 每 the universe, for the creation of which many detective fans will always be grateful to Aoyama-sensei. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Simply a masterpiece! 
 
Delve into the mind of one the greatest mangaka artists of the late-80's to early-90's era, whilst taking pleasure in his eccentric universe and fantastic storytelling. While this short was released almost 16 years ago--as of writing this review--, the legacy of Aoyama's great works carries on. 
His distinctive art-style left many, to this day, pondering whether to count it as a welcomed gift to the animanga world, or as a defiant far cry from the industry-standard of ""moe"", which have made it susceptible to criticism. 
 
The specials follow 7 episodes, with the 7th being an episode that details the process of making Meitantei Conan. These shorts are excellent, and let me tell you why: Aoyama's universe is unchanging, unflinching, and perfectly in sync. Classical stories, classical characters, and heck, even classical voice-overs, in an intact universe, where you get to see amazing characters that live within Aoyama's world besides Conan and Ran, and how they live throughout the day. Aoyama's stories display to us how he has an excellent command on combining a realistic worldview, authentic Japanese culture, with (sometimes) quirky low-level fantasy and magic of Sakura trees turning old samurais into youthful kend身 masters, genius children falling from grace, a ridiculously short detective that maintains a sharp image with a confident aura that surrounds him, and a crazy love story on the most special day in the most average man's life. 
 
These specials are short, and they're meant to be that way. These are normal characters in the Meitantei Conan universe that will probably never get anymore screen time, and that's only because their author opted for them to remain normal, yet, show us the most interesting day in their lives. The subtlety is what makes these specials so interesting. 
 
These characters will carry on their lives normally, but one thing for sure, is that Aoyama wanted us to take a glimpse of the most special and crazy day in their lives. Sanjuro will probably die of old age, living the rest of his life peacefully in rural Japan. And we will probably never know of what happens next, to the most awesome detective that is George and his new-found secretary, with their constant silly adventures. Keisuke will continue on with his life, but he will never forget that special day that made him fall in love with an idol. 
 
It's important to note that the specials also provide an entertaining look into Shinchi's parents, back when he was a small child. I believe this begs the question: do I need to watch Detective Conan to enjoy these specials? With the exclusion of the specials containing Shinchi's parents, the answer is absolutely not! These specials tell the short stories of characters within Aoyama's universe, and while they share the same world, it certainly won't affect the experience. Fans of Aoyama's works however, will certainly take a liking to this, as they crave more of his world outside of Conan and Kaito. 
 
In the end, why did I gave these specials a 10? Aside from the great stories, terrific characters, classical late-90's soundtrack, and exquisite voice-overs from seasoned veterans that voiced characters in the Meitantei Conan series, a comparative review could easily give this score over and over no matter how many times you look at it. 
In today's anime shows, we are constantly met with bland, cheap, or abusive stories. Just the other day I watched an anime short, and that pretty much gave me an idea of the industry's current state. 
 
The anime was about an otaku who married a normal girl, and while the premise was preparing for something very interesting, and even MAL listed its genre as seinen, it fell short right around the 2nd episode, where they added a shotacon filled with a deep brother-complex, fast forward to the 10th episode, and then you have an ensemble cast of weeaboos, ""quirky"" moe characters, absolutely no character development, no story progression, they just go to conventions and sell doujins, half the show was moe scenes. That's it. 
 
So if you ask me, in comparison to today's anime standards, does this deserve a perfect 10? Yes, yes it does. It's a complete and concise special that fills the gaps on every end, and certainly leaves you wanting for more. It's perfect. That would be my answer. 
 
Thank you for reading.

          
 
       Helpful TL;DR Some interesting concepts.  A refreshing break from Detective Conan 
 
Gosho Aoyama's short stories collection is a collection of, well, short stories.  There are seven stories in all, each of various length.  Some runs for the full episode length while others run much shorter.  Each of the stories are self-contained, although I like the fact that some of the stories are loosely connected in some ways. 
 
The stories are set in the Detective Conan world, but are in no way connected to any of its characters.  One story features a tiny-size detective, another story features an old man magically becomes young again.  They are in the realm of fantasy, sure, but they work surprisingly well.  Just do not expect to have the same quality as Aoyama's more famous work, Detective Conan.  Speaking of which, some of the stories features Conan's parents, which is somewhat refreshing, because we don't see much of them in Detective Conan. 
 
If you are looking for murder mystery like those in Detective Conan, you should watch Detective Conan instead.  The short stories are nothing like DC.  They are light hearted, sometimes out of this world, and project a very creative and imaginary scenario to the viewers.  Some of the 'concept' from the stories work its way into the DC world. 
 
Throughout the stories, you might notice some cameo appearance by the cast of Detective Conan.  It was fun spotting Agasa or Mori or even Ran.  As the anime is done in the last century, the artwork is what you would expect from that era.  Art style are very similar to Detective Conan, with its distinctive Aoyama look and feel.  Some of the voice actors from Detective Conan can be clearly identified in these stories.  If you have watched Detective Conan for any considerable of time, you can easily tell the voice actors in these stories. 
 
As a whole, the short stories are a break from Detective Conan.  If you are open to small people, time travel and the likes, have a go at this.  It is not a top quality show, but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless.

The plot follows Conan Edogawa who sets out to apprehend Ars豕ne Lupin III, the suspect of stealing a jewel called Cherry Sapphire. 
 
(Souce: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Shounen']","Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan: The Movie begins with another daring theft committed by Kaito Kid, with a fabulous diamond as his target - only that Kaito is in this case merely a spectator from the sidelines. Other discrepancies in this case include ""Kid"" using a real gun and a high-powered boat, instead of his standard hang glider cape, to make his getaway. Conan Edogawa takes up pursuit, but is foiled by a shadowy figure using a sword to slice his skateboard in two; only then does he realize the true identity of the culprit: Lupin III.
As it turns out, Lupin acts under coercion; his love interest, Fujiko Mine, is being used as a hostage, with an explosive collar around her neck which will detonate if Lupin does not cooperate. The theft of the diamond, which Lupin discards shortly afterwards, was nothing more than a test of his abilities, as his real target is a gemstone named the Cherry Sapphire his ""employer"", a mystery man calling himself Alan Smithee, is after. Mystified by Lupin's behavior, the Tokyo Police under Inspector Megure consults Lupin's would-be-nemesis Inspector Koichi Zenigata, with Miwako Sato and Wataru Takagi volunteering as assistants. However, despite Zenigata's precautions, Lupin, disguised as Takagi, manages to steal the gem and get away.
Simultaneously, a famous young Italian pop singer named Emilio Baretti is arriving in Japan to conduct a concert tour; but amidst the news coverage Conan notices Daisuke Jigen among Baretti's entourage. Ran Mouri's friend Sonoko Suzuki arranges for a pre-concert meeting with her idol in his hotel, but upon arrival they stumble upon Megure and the police in Baretti's suite, along with his manager, Claudia Belucci, and his producer, Luciano Carnevale. Baretti has received a threat letter telling him to cancel his concert or be killed. Despite the danger to Baretti's life, Carnevale insists that the concert take place as scheduled. When Ran and Sonoko decide to leave, Conan stays behind to look for Jigen, whom he finds acting as Baretti's bodyguard, although he evidently pursues yet another agenda.
In the meantime, Ran and Sonoko are suddenly joined by Baretti for a clandestine tour of Tokyo Skytree. Once there, he climbs to a high rampant in a desperate attempt to see the concert cancelled; when Ran finds him there, she begins reprimanding him, thinking he wants to commit suicide. A wind blast nearly blows them both off the tower, but they are saved by the combined efforts of Conan, Jigen and Sonoko. Chastised, Baretti confesses that Carnevale, who is affiliated with the Italian Mafia, uses his concerts as a cover to conduct illegal dealings, and therefore Baretti made up the threat to his life in order to have the Japan concert, an anacrusis for yet another deal, called off.
Eventually, Baretti's concert starts as scheduled. However, Carnevale manages to evade police surveillance and make his way to Haneda Airport, where he meets with Smithee to conduct the deal. However, it is revealed at this point that the middleman who arranged this meeting and the owner of the Cherry Sapphire were Lupin's associates Daisuke Jigen and Goemon Ishikawa; Lupin has been in fact hired by the Vespanian government to retrieve a rare piece of ore stolen by Carnevale, a mineral which enables the construction of ultimate stealth technology. Smithee, a native from the (fictional) country of Gillanba, intended to use the ore to offset the military might of a neighboring country, a purpose neither the late queen of Vespania, Sakura, nor her daughter and successor Mira have been endorsing.
However, Smithee has brought heavily armed reinforcements, and despite the help of most of Conan and Lupin's friends, Smithee finds an opening which enables him to take Conan as a hostage. Smithee and Carnevale attempt to escape by plane, but Lupin boards the craft, and he and Conan prepare to take down Smithee for good. Carnevale arrives and wildly fires a minigun at them, damaging the flight controls, mortally wounding Smithee and puncturing the hull, causing himself to be sucked out by the sudden decompression. When military jets attack, intending to destroy the ore samples before they can leave the country, Lupin reveals that the Cherry Sapphire is also made from a piece of Vespanian ore. After using it successfully to thwart the missiles shot at them, Conan and Lupin abandon the crashing plane via parachute and are subsequently picked up by a submarine temporarily appropriated by Fujiko and Ai Haibara.
In a post-credit scene, Conan, Ran and Haibara see Baretti off safely as he departs Japan. Lupin, in the meantime, tries to steal a national treasure from a Kansai temple, only to find Kaito Kid having already beaten him to it and alerted the police as payback for dressing up as him.
","A fun romp of a movie that starts has Lupin having fun with extravagant robberies, Fujiko in trouble, and Conan and his gang solving mysteries. This movie had me sit up and take notice three minutes in when it did a mock opening sequence for both Lupin and Conan. It is almost word for word from each show, first with Conan narrating an updated Green Jacket style opening and then Lupin doing the same for Conan's standard opening. It's very clever and will grab any fan of either series happy.  
 
STORY: This movie is a direct sequel to the popular Lupin vs. Conan special from 2012. In case you didn't see it, don't worry, this movie has a summary clip in the closing credits. The series will also make you do a double take a few times as it gives tongue in cheek references to Conan characters and more Lupin references (like the Fujiko series and the Gold of Babylon movie) than Green vs. Red. 
 
CHARACTER: Zenigata is given more lines and more personality in this special, but it seems forced. Still, the differences detracted slightly from the movie. Zenigata also has a very pointed line (I really don't know how to word that without giving it away) that seems like it's there for different types of fans. I'm interested to see how they'll translate it when the movie is dubbed. The more I think about it, maybe Zenigata's personality is changed due to the fact that he has a competent partner (a Conan character) in the movie?  
 
As for other characters! Conan and Jigen play off the relationship they had in the first special, and it works out hilariously well. Because Conan can arguably be meant for a younger audience, Jigen and Goemon are less gritty and Fujiko isn't as sexualized. I got a kick out of the Conan kids and how they all worked with the Lupin gang. I thought that with such a large cast it might feel forced, but it didn't at all.  
 
The only issue was the ""flavor of the week"" characters, whose problems I found myself glossing over heavily. The movie does not make you care about them at all, which I think is the problem: the first special was about Lupin and Conan while this one was about Lupin, Conan, and a third party.  
 
ART: You have to understand that these are two different styles of animation. However, the Lupin franchise has done a great job over the years mixing in other styles with their own.  
 
A problem with mixing styles that are so different is that they don't play well together. For example, every time the Conan characters have a scene where they're shown from the side (profile), I couldn't get over the elongated face, almost like an animal's muzzle, and sharply upturned nose. It's easy to move into that world of animation while watching Conan, but when it mixes with the old, long legged Lupin characters grates on the senses. Lupin's characters are long limbed and gritty detailed. Putting these two in the same scenes together doesn't work fantastically. For instance, one of Conan's characters has big, blue eyes. She's talking to Zenigata who does his bow legged walk out of the room. Then the Conan characters are shown from the side and look almost inhuman. So you're left with a dissonance in which you have to force yourself to believe this is the same anime universe. 
 
SOUND: The usual Lupin and Conan cast sounds great! Only problem (to me) is that in an effort to merge the two, they limit the amount of jazz that Lupin fans might be used to hearing.  
 
ENJOYMENT: Very enjoyable! Lupin and his gang over the years have gotten more family friendly and this definitely falls in that vein. I'd describe it as fluffier than many Disney movies. But hey, you want gritty? Go watch the Fujiko series and Jigen movie...

          
 
       Helpful A befitting sequel to the previous crossover, this movie has everything you'd expect from fans of both series. It's always challenging to bring together a mainly shounen Conan series against a more seinen Lupin III, but the movie makers have got the formula right. The plot and execution make up for a movie full of thrill and fun.  The Detective Conan cast provides the perfect comic timing and is well complemented by the action packed Lupin III crew.  
 
While distinct from the prequel, watchers are advised to view it or they might otherwise miss out on certain parts. The sheer number of characters in both series allows little screen time for the side characters, but you will definitely have your fill of the protagonists. I look forward to more crossovers between the two series.

Using three-minute episodes,  Vampire Holmes  retells the story of the great Holmes and his assistant. What begins as an ordinary detective agency takes a turn for the occult when the Metropolitan Police of London secretly hire Holmes and Hudson to investigate vampires. 
 
Or at least that's what Holmes would tell anyone who asks. In reality, he and Hudson spend most of their time sitting around arguing, and failing to solve any cases. Joined by the not-so-black, demon cat Kira, and their terrifying rent-hungry landlady, this is the story of the man who was most definitely not London's greatest detective.","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural']",none,"In my opinion, the synopsis of Vampire Holmes gave me an idea of something that sounded promising. It was not even close to how it really was. 
 
STORY (1/10) 
The opening might seem promising, but hardly anything shown in it will be mentioned throughout the course of the story. Through about three quarters of the anime, there is absolutely no plot. For episodes on end, it only displays Holmes in his home together with Hudson, doing nothing of importance. You might find yourself continuously waiting for something plot-like to happen, and then the episode ends. Closing to the end, some things shown in the OP are finally displayed, but in the end are never explained. As a side-effect of not having any plot in the early, incredibly short episodes, the story ends on an unsatisfying note as they have never mentioned any of the elements before it happens. You're left with a vague and confusing case closed, left unexplained.  
 
ART (1/10) 
The art is downright terrible. The animation is close to non-existent and does not flow well. It's fairly easy to tell that frames are being re-used, and frequently looks unfinished and thrown together, either because of a tight schedule, or pure laziness. The backgrounds are nothing to brag about either, as they are overly simple and at times have varying art styles clashing with the style of the characters and the mood of the scene. The art is overall very lazily executed. The opening has better visuals than the rest. 
 
SOUND (3/10) 
I took no note of the work of the voice actors. Watching a car crash, it's hard to notice the surroundings. The opening (and ending) song called Everlasting Love was around average, but felt so out of place with the overall feel of the (imaginary) plot. It was, in truth, not a good match for this anime, and made the already bad content even more ridiculous. 
 
CHARACTER (1/10) 
The characters are unusually flat and one-dimensional, and there is no character development present. That makes sense in a way, as there is nothing to get any development from. 
 
ENJOYMENT (4/10) 
As strange as it is, I did enjoy this to an extent. Though the comedy was for the most of the time out of place and felt forced, some parts were enjoyable. But, to tell the truth, the true comedy was in the horrid art, the unrealistic characters, and the misplaced opening song.  
 
Vampire Holmes having such short episodes might be its biggest weakness, but I don't dare to imagine how it would have been if it did have standard-length episodes. All in all, not an anime I would recommend, unless bad anime is wanted.

          
 
       Helpful There's bad and then there's Vampire Holmes.  
 
I have a hard time understanding what the screenwriters behind this ""thing"" were thinking when they all sat down to write it. Did they all huddle together, started snickering as someone blurted out ""let's create the tritest, most unfunny thing imaginable!""? Because honestly, I'm having a hard time seeing the inception of this project being anything else. To put it in perspective, shows like Ninja Slayer, Inferno Cop and others are along those lines are Shakespearean masterpieces by comparison.  
 
This isn't the ""so bad it's good"" kind of title.  
This is the ""so bad, please end my life"" kind of nonsense. 
 
I can't even bring myself to write a troll review dubbing it a ""masterpiece"" since that would require more care than the show even put forward towards itself. It's simply not worth that kind of effort 〞 hell, even bothering to write about it is too much as it is.

","This crime anime may seem somewhat childish at first, but eventually a true appreciation for the intricate plots both episodically and arcing emerges along with a respect for each character. There are emotional angst-y parts nicely balanced with adorable comedy and character interactions. Fun to watch alone, but even more fun to watch with another friend or two to guess ""who done it"" for each mystery plot ; ) For an anime with murders as the most common crime there is very little bloody violence, so good for younger and older crowds.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
The drama ''Tantei Gakuen Q'' is one of my favourites, and I watched it long before i decided to watch the anime. Since dramas follow (but always not too closely) the original manga/anime, i had expected to see some similar cases the characters faced in the drama, in the anime. I can't say that i am disappointed, when i discovered that it was true. All the cases are just as appalling, and even though i knew what is going to happen next (for some), i find myself hoping and waiting for whatsoever to happen. 
 
Art: 
The art is not my cup of tea, and because i usually look at the art before watching any anime, i was put off by it. It is okay when i watch it for a long period of time. 
 
Sound: 
When watching anime, i would not really notice the sound. The OP and ED themes are considerably good, so i guess it was fine. 
 
Character: 
I really like the characters. All the various characters have their own unique personalities, and for the characters in the Q and A class, that plays a huge role. Their personalities affect the way they think, observe the case and deduce, after all. To add on, the one thing i like about Tantei Gakuen Q is that the main lead is not the only ''intelligent'' one in the Q class. He and this other (mysterious and seemingly dark) guy work together exceptionally well, to the point where i think that they can communicate through telepathy.  
 
Enjoyment: 
I enjoyed the anime a lot, but there are also quite a number of unsatisfactory areas. Aside from the fact that the plot remains hanging at the end, i also dislike the fact that Tantei Gakuen Q does not give a serious feel. Perhaps it is because it is targeted more towards a younger audience, that is why the plot remains light. 
 
Overall: 
As a mystery fan, i would consider Tantei Gakuen Q a must watch. I would put it as that this is what i believe a true detective story is like, despite the unsatisfactory points. Last but not least, i definitely hope for a second season to come out so as to solve all the unsolved mysteries.

          
 
       Helpful Tantei Gakuen Q is pretty much just another detective show with fairly interesting mysteries for all the detective addicts to get high on. Based on the manga by Seimaru Amagi and Fumiya Satou, Tantei Gakuen Q is about the young Kyuu, who is talented at deduction and reasoning. He eventually enrolls into the famed Dan Detective School, a specialist school that train students into detectives. He befriends a number of the other students in the school, each with their own specific talents. Together their group tackles a number of mysteries and crimes that occur. 
 
Tantei Gakuen Q is episodic, with each episode mostly focusing on different crimes that occur around Kyuu and his friends. There are a number of multi-episode mysteries in the show, which in my opinion are much more interesting, witty and detailed compared to the one-shot mysteries. Majority of the mysteries are fun to watch, with some crimes containing tricks that are incredibly complicated. Occasionally the story may drift to cheesiness, and certain parts may be quite predictable. A plotline runs throughout the entire series, although the main focus of the show is still on the specific crimes in each case. The ending of the anime, unfortunately, is rather unsatisfying, with the previously mentioned main plotline finishing off rather unresolved. 
 
The animation is rather plain, and contains nothing special. Occasionally, characters may appear disfigured, but with the focus of the viewer on the mysteries occurring in the show, animation is most likely the last thing on everyone＊s minds. Character designs are simple and more or less unappealing. It is a wonder with the logical nature of this show why the main character has green and white hair (even as a child). 
 
For the sound, voice acting is satisfying. No character really stands out with an incredible voice actor although you may find one or two characters with a VA that you would rather not have to listen to. The background music is rather enjoyable to listen to, if not overused in the show. You＊ll most likely not complain if you like it enough that you wouldn＊t mind the same piece to be played over and over again. The openings and endings are rather unmemorable. Especially with the cliffhanger endings in the show, a lot of people would probably rather skip through the opening if they could. With that said, the openings and endings are not bad per se, and I find the first opening to be excellent. 
 
Characters are not really the strongest point in the show. Character development is near non-existent, from the beginning to the very end; characters more or less still act the same (with an exception of a few individuals). Each of the main characters have their own specific traits and talents, and help out in each of the cases using these traits. The teachers in the show are hardly ever seen, and are pretty much forgettable. The criminals are rather generic, with their weak revenge driven hearts, anger, greed, selfishness or tragic upbringings or events that lead them to do their crimes. 
 
As for why I like Tantei Gakuen Q, the tricks used in the show were fascinating. I did not really care much for any other aspect of the show; the mystery was pretty much the only thing I found really going for it. The drama in the show was frankly rather annoying and cheesy to watch most of the time. I also wish the show wasn＊t aimed at kids. 
 
Overall, Tantei Gakuen Q is pretty much an anime that the mystery and detective lovers would probably like the most. It doesn＊t have much else going for it except for the specific stories in each of the cases. If you would like to give your deduction skills a try, go ahead and watch Tantei Gakuen Q. All hints are always given and fully explained in the show. Be warned though, some of the tricks are complicated and not exactly the sort of thing an average person is going to suddenly think up.

","As of this review, I have just finished this series and decided to give it my own review. I would like to keep it brief and, although it will be opinionated, concise as possible. Without further adieu, lets get into. 
 
Story: 6 
You read the synopsis just as well as I so you should sort've know what you're in for. The storytelling, albeit fast-paced, is actually written decently in my opinion. While each mystery was fun to solve in it's own right (fan of the mystery genre), until the later half of the series, they are all somewhat predictable; effectively causing the reveals to be little more than explanations for those who couldn't figure it out. All in all, as a mystery piece is wasn't too bad and as a story overall, I believe you'll be drawn to it if you stick around for episode 5+. 
 
Art: 7 
Long story short, the art was better than average and aside from the pointy chins, as others have pointed out, it was well animated and had some very nice sequences towards the finale. 
 
Sound: 8 
So the soundtrack, which for me consisted of the opening theme, ending theme, and the climax theme (Spanish flamenco as one user put it), was well done. I'm a huge fan of the ending theme for being catchy despite my american tongue falling over the lyrics to it. As for the climax theme, the little tune was literally my favorite part of the show and the only part i paid attention to during the first few episodes. Again, all in all, wonderfully scored. 
 
Character: 5 
Simplified and to the point, aside from Inga and Kazamori, the rest of the characters were either bland with no development or developed into something cliche. Without providing spoilers, most are very cliche in their roles for the plot and aside from the last 3 episodes I was very bored with their development as a whole. Despite that last sentence, I found nearly everyone of them like-able in their respective roles. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
As you can tell so far ( at least I hope), despite how the review came off, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It captivated me with its music, intriguing way of spinning the stories each episode was based off of and overall telling of the conflict between the searching of necessary  truth and the telling of necessary lies. 
 
So overall the show gets a 6.6 from me, which rounds to a 7 here. Give it a chance. You just may find yourself captivated by the more underlying themes I failed to mention in this review! :P

          
 
       Helpful Un-Go can particularity be characterized as one of by biggest disappointments right along with Toradora!, Shinrei Tantei Yakumo and Eden of the East movies. 
 
The story of this anime is solid (at least in the beginning)  and the futurism appeals to me. The protagonist knack for solving mysteries and the unfairness of others stealing his credit was all very interesting. However the pacing, of the reveal and generally of the anime, killed it. By the end the story just didn't make sense and it felt like there was no real progress made from the promising beginning.  
 
I expected Un-Go to be a mix between Majin Tantei and Eden of the East, however it ended up being Shinrei Tantei Yakumo, a promising story and characters without following through. Truly a wasted potential.  
 
However, as in any disappointing anime, perhaps it was the subjective feeling of expecting too much that really got to me. The art was good and the sound even better, Blue Light Yokohama stuck in my head for the whole month! Still, as I stated, and will again, no art or sound can compensate for lacking in story and characters. I was truly disappointed.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Well, I'm not a fan of detectives series, but after watching Kami-sama no memo chou (wich one I liked) I decided to give it a chance to Bones' one. 
 
The Story, well you know, those type of very weirdo cases that nobody can solve, but we 'got the ""freelance bad*ss"" detective who can, and if he can't, he has those friends-henchmen that helps him. Everybody knows that henchmen (secundary characters) on anime are more cool than the protagonist, so you can know where the story goes with this. 
 
Art: At first, it reminds me to Mawaru Penguindrum, and I loved that, Pako and Yun made a perfect job. They keep it simple but awesome. For the scenarios, to be honest i didn't pay attention. 
 
Sound: I love that ""spanish flamenco"" background music that sounds when we get to the climax of every episode, I really want to get the OST for this one. for the Opening and Ending, well. The electro-pop of LAMA it's perfect and being honest I met School Food Punishment with the Opening, but I liked it. 
 
Characters: Just Inga, Everybody (yeah, even you) loves Aki Toyosaki's voice, I think this one is one of her best characters (after Yui, of course). Sasa it's pretty original, liked that. Rie, the classic female character who becomes my Waifu. Shinju, the badass... yeap. 
 
Enjoyment: The first cases (episodes) are so easy to discover who's the guilty (crown... NOT) but after the first episodes (I know that you hear that a lot) it gets pretty cool.

Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases. Nonetheless, after Kudo solves one, he will use Dr. Agasa's hidden tranquilizer to sedate Richard and then uses a voice changer to simulate his voice to reveal the solution. He also enrolls in Teitan Elementary School where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective Club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with other characters, including his neighbor, Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena Sebastian (Sonoko Suzuki), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), assorted police detectives from different regions, and a phantom thief called the Kaito Kid.
Kudo later encounters an elementary school transfer student, Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), who reveals herself to be a former member of the Black Organization under the code name ""Sherry"" and the creator of the experimental drug that shrunk him. She too had ingested it to evade the pursuit of the organization. She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy.

In this ONAS, we have yet another intellectual challenge for lil Conan. In his apparently series of neverending adventures, he faced countless villains (which stars between one and three episodes), mobster, Kaito Kid and even Lupin III... but now, Edowaga's facing the Wooo. Who's the Wooo? Is... a TV (a Hitachi one, btw). Surprise, surprise, this is a commercial! But before you complain about how Conan sold out, let's see what this is all about.  
 
There are two ads, each with a different story. In the first one, the Mouri family enjoys a new television program about detectives, in which Kogoro is very good discovering the culprit... way too good to be true. Unfortunately, since this is the first episode, there wasn't a NEXT CONAN'S HINT! thingy that help us to reach the answer... so, I will give you a hint: the Wooo is involved.  
In episode number two, a couple has a discussion about how and when they should record their television shows (serious business, people... I think there was an actress daughter in the middle, but don't fool ourselves: the important thing is the TV). Since their dilemma is quite tricky, they decide to ask for the help of a world known detective... but don't worry, Conan will use his uncanny deductive skills to realize that certain bun looks like a cat, and the everybody will be happy. Really, that's what happens.  
 
But it doesn't end there, no. In both eps, there's detailed info (in the episode itself, and in the ending.. because yes, there's an ending in this production) of how the various gimmicks of the Wooo works, like the simultaneous watching/recording option, the DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance), the storage system... oh Wooo, there's something you can't do?  
 
The characters involved are the classic four: Conan, Ran, Kogoro and Agasa, with random cameos from other minor characters in the form of television commercials (yes, there are ads in the ad...), like the detective boys. Producers were also able to convince the legendary door that opens/closes in the middle of the ep to work in this project. The new member of the cast is, of course, a spectacular Hitachi flat screen TV, that was so popular among fans, that there were numerous requests that Wooo replace Genta's character in the series.  
 
On the audiovisual level, DCvs.W (holy, you turn that W down, and it looks like you have a Batman vs. Ironman showdown) is impeccable. Both animation and sound are so good that you don't even need a Woo to appreciate it! (And damn, that's saying a lot).  
 
So, seriously speaking, you may have noted that this is a giant joke. But is a very funny one: it really worth the watch, at least to laugh at how blatant the whole deal is. Although, it's supposed to be shameless, after all, is publicity. So, this is for Detective Conan fans (if you are wandering, there aren't any kind of spoilers here, so you could watch this if you watched 10 episodes of the anime) that want to laugh a little (or buy a badass TV, more advanced than Optimus Prime, apparently), yet, for that, remember that you are not supposed to take this seriously. Have fun!

16,1363,17,7.941200453,Detective and his or her helper,Detective Conan Movie 04: Captured in Her Eyes,"On a rainy afternoon, the Detective Boys witness a murder across the street. Barred by traffic, the culprit slips away and Conan Edogawa is left a single clue by a dying detective. Days later, another detective is found murdered in a parking lot, leaving the police rattled. Suspicious that the culprit is one of their own, everyone in the police department without an alibi is suspect. But despite being on high alert, they are outmaneuvered and suffer yet another attack〞this time with Ran Mouri finding herself in the crossfire. 
 
Traumatized, Ran wakes in the hospital with retrograde amnesia, remembering nothing about her life. Soon released, she struggles to remember her past and grows fearful of not regaining her memories before being targeted by the killer for what she witnessed. As she is guarded by friends and family, it is up to Conan to piece together the clues and find who the murderer is before they strike again. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']","Ran has a flashback of Shinichi taking her to the fountain at Tropical Land, the local amusement park. Conan (using Shinichi＊s voice) calls Ran in a phone booth and she asks if they could go back to Tropical Land. The Detective Boys passes by causing Conan to quickly hang up.
The kids have come up with a new riddle but Conan solves it easily. Genta tries to cross a busy street, but policeman Osamu Narasawa stops him and advises the kids to wait for the next green light. When they finish crossing, Conan turns to see a mysterious man with an umbrella shoot Osamu. The man runs, and Conan attempts to give chase but is unable to. When Conan asks Osamu if he knew who shot him, the man grabs for his notebook and succumbs to his injuries.
The Detective Boys is taken to a police conference because they were witnesses to the crime. However, the conference goes nowhere as Ayumi, Mitshuiko, and Genta disagree on how the culprit looked. Conan states that the culprit's raincoat and umbrella were both a shade of gray, remembering that the umbrella was in their right hand, proving that the culprit was left-handed, as the gun was shot with the left.
Later, a woman in a garage finds Detective Shiba shot to death, who was holding his police notebook in his right hand. The following morning, Kogoro asks Megure for more details, but Megure hangs up, saying that he is busy. Megure is shown talking to Santos, saying that the information only the two of them know must remain a secret.
Shiratori＊s sister later has a party to bless her marriage. When Kogoro sees Megure again, he tries to get info, but the Megure remains silent. Conan realizes that Meguire may know something that is kept confidential. Kogoro and Conan later try to blackmail Takagi using the info that Takagi likes Sato. Takagi tells Kogoro and Conan that the second victim held his notebook during his dying moments, something not mentioned to the media. Shiratori appears and tells Kogoro that all the info he will be getting, and that he ""need not to know."" Conan thinks of the words and fears the killer may be associated to the police force, or the entire force itself.
Sonoko and Ran are shown asking Eri how Kogoro proposed to her, while Sato goes to the bathroom. Ran runs into her as she leaves. The culprit then sets off a bomb, cutting off power to the floor. Ran picks up a flashlight from under the sink, which the killer uses to shoot. Sato, however, shields Ran and is shot multiple times. Light from the flashlight shines on the culprit's face (the traditional humanoid silhouette). Sato is shown unconscious, and Ran faints when she sees her bloody hands, blaming herself for what has happened. At the hospital, Megure states Sato has a 50-50 chance of living. Surgeon-turned-psychiatrist Kyosuke Kazato diagnoses Ran with amnesia, explaining that she lost memories of everybody she knew, including the memories of the current day.
Megure decides to reveal the info about the case to Kogoro. A gifted surgeon named Thomas Jinno got drunk and committed suicide by slitting his neck. Inspector Tomonari  led the investigation with his subordinates Osamu, Shiba, and Sato. During the case, Tomonari suffered a heart attack, insists that no one worry, and to continue the stakeout. Sato is forced to send Tomonari to the hospital, where he dies from his condition. The remaining two see the targets, noticing that one of them is Chief Toshiro Odarigi's son, Toshiya. The case was, however, abruptly concluded as suicide. Megure concludes his description of the case by informing that Simone and the others have recently been investigating the case on their free time.
Someone has been stalking Ran in the hospital's courtyard and inside her hospital room, leading Conan to inform Kogoro that she may have seen the culprit, which makes her a possible target.
The next day, the Detective Boys stays with Ran, acting as bodyguards. Ai remarks that it may be better if Ran＊s memory wouldn't return and that she wished she lost hers too. It can be noted that she reveals feelings for Conan, only to put it off as a joke. While at her house, Ran states she is nostalgic when she sees Shinichi＊s picture. The Detective Boys, not knowing Conan is Shinichi, criticizes Shinichi for being insensitive for not returning to visit Ran. Conan is visibly upset and angry about the situation. That same night, Ran asks Conan about Shinichi.
The following day, Ran, Eri, and Conan are waiting at the subway station to go shopping when suddenly, the culprit pushes Ran off onto the rails, only for Conan to save her life.
Conan is shown deeply investigating the people related to Jinno, which leads him to finally realize who the culprit is. A major breakthrough, however, is that Jinno cut the doctor who was operating on a patient who suffered from a heart attack. This apparently caused the patient's death.
Ran, at the hospital, sees Tropical Land on television, prompting the others to take her there hoping it helps with her memory. Takagi later goes to the bathroom, and a mascot character of Tropical Land approaches Rachel. The Detective Boys chases the mascot and takes them down. Kogoro removes the mascot head revealing Makoto Tomonari, son of the late Inspector Tomonari. He also finds the knife in his chest pocket. Makoto claims innocence, but arrests him. The kids celebrate their victory, but Ai doubts that this is the end. Toshiya, one of the suspects in the case, is watching quietly with a smirk on his face. Kogoro tells Ran that he's going to the police station for questioning and also tells her to stay at the Tropical Land until she regains her memory.
At the police station, Makoto is questioned. He reveals that he wasn't approaching Ran but instead he wanted to talk to Richard for his help; his knife was for protection from the killer. The men are stunned at Makoto＊s confessions, and realize Ran is in grave danger.
Back at Tropical Land, the real killer attacks Ran, but Dr. Agasa protects her and is shot himself. Conan rushes to her aid and quickly takes her deep into Tropical Land, boarding a speedboat with the culprit tailing right behind them in his own. When the culprit corners them at a volcano, Conan lays down his theories. The killer is the surgeon who's hand was cut by Jinno, psychiatrist Kyosuke Kazato. He murdered Jinno as revenge for having injured his hands, ruining his promising career. After Kazato resigned, he became a psychiatrist, was consulted by one of the officers under the late Tomonari, and found out that Jinno's case 
was reopened. Kazato would go on and murder all the connections to the case. Ran became a target because she saw his face when he attacked Sato.
Conan and Ran escape via a tunnel from Kazato temporarily. Kazato catches up with them, and Conan concludes his presentation, explaining how Kazato shot Sato through an umbrella prepared with a hole in it, thus leaving no gun residue on his clothes when he stuck his arm through the hole and fired his weapon. As evidence, the victims were referring to the heart, which is a pun on Kazato past profession as a heart surgeon. Kazato approaches with a gun, and Ran asks Conan why is he protecting her, to which Conan replies that he loves her. They evade Kazato again, and Conan takes Ran to the fountain, the same place where Shinichi took Ran a long time ago. Kazato finds them and starts shooting at Conan. As the fountain turns on, Ran breaks free of her amnesia, able to remember Sato protecting her previously. She has flashbacks of multiple scenes, including one where she witnesses Kazato＊s  face. The fountain turns off, giving Conan the chance to kick a Coco-Cola can at Kazato, knocking him out. He wakes up while Conan does not notice, and right when he is about to stab Conan, Ran breaks the blade with her kick, shocking Kazato. She then recalls all the events and proceeds to brutally knock out Kazato, finally defeating him. Everyone then appears and Kazato is taken into custody. News later comes that Sato survived the surgery, and will be making a full recovery.
Ran tells Conan the line her dad told her mom was that he loved her more than anything else in the world, leaving Conan saying that he can't believe he used the same pick-up line as that stupid old man, referring to Kogoro.
","MOD EDIT: Spoilers below. 
 
Captured In Her Eyes is the best movie of Detective Conan. Shinichi confessed that he likes Ran. Ran lost his memory and no matter how Shinichi wanted to appear to her as Shinichi and comfort her...thinking of it just made it harder for him. And also that Haibara almost confessed to Shinichi...that part is really something. The thrill, the excitement, the romance, the mystery being revealed...I really like it so much! 
 
It's so painful even for a great detective like himself not to be able to help the one you consider the most important in the world...but because of the unexpected situation he got himself into, he made a really big sacrifice. Shinichi doesn't want to hurt Ran and that made it a lot difficult for him especially when he sees that the only one Ran felt nostalgic about after losing her memory is his picture. And in here, Conan got saluted by a high ranked officer of the police department. It's really good!

       Helpful Detective Conan: Captured in Her Eyes is often held as a classic among fans for its great characterization and emotional moments. I would argue that this was the first Detective Conan movie to get the format right, as it has more cohesion and consistency than its last film. 
 
A lot of the emotion comes from Ran losing her memories after a traumatic experience with the murderer. The fact that Conan can't do anything as Shinichi to help her is a very cruel thing to undergo. But despite that, Ran is still still just as much her awesome self as she was with her memories. The fact that she still chooses to keep a positive outlook after the incident is probably one of my favorite things about her and why I love this movie so much. One of my favorite parts about this movie is the finale in Tropical Land, which is home to some of the most imaginative environments in a Detective Conan movie. Combine that with a well-polished art style and what you have is a movie that's both fun and good to look at. 
 
The movie itself, while interesting, is admittedly kind of slow. Having to wait while Conan plays catch-up with the audience is one of the least exciting moments in the film. Also, the case itself isn't that very interesting to solve, with the first clue about the culprit being heavily reliant on Japanese wordplay. It's very clear that the movie was more focused on Ran's amnesiac experience than the mystery itself. By no means is that a bad thing, as a lot of the emotion comes from everyone dealing with her loss of memories. If you are looking for a movie with a great mystery to solve, this may not be the one for you. 
 
Captured in Her Eyes is one of my favorite Detective Conan movies. While the case itself isn't much to write home about, the fun character moments and polished visuals are what keeps this movie highly rated for me.

She finally wins the reluctant approval of her father, and embarks on an exciting life of mystery and suspense〞his only demand being that she occasionally spend some time with her great-aunt, Jane Marple, in the small village of St. Mary Mead.","['Historical', 'Mystery']",none,"""Agatha Christie no Meitantei Poirot to Marple"" is a decent effort to bring the two mainstays of Agatha Christie's books, Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple, to life using the form of Anime. However, it is also a kids show. The connecting and central character of this show, Maybelle West, is a young wannabe sleuth who, along with her pet duck Oliver, go around assisting the two titular detectives in solving their mysteries.  
 
The show's strong points are also where they lucked out, Agatha Christie's mysteries and characters are just as enjoyable in Anime form as anywhere else. Poirot is the eccentric dandy who relies upon ""the little grey cells"" to solve his cases while the down to earth Ms. Marple is the country woman who uses ""human nature"" to resolve the mysteries that come her way. Each are a little reigned in, but nevertheless still very accurate versions of their book selves. Same for the plots, each a little simplified but still get to the core of the piece they're adapting. 
 
The art is bright, simple, and colorful. Keeps things cheerful while everyone in the room is looking at a dead body. Y'know, for the kids? Also, the voice acting is terrific. As a big Hercule Poirot fan, I especially enjoyed the performance by K身tar身 Satomi as the Belgian super sleuth. He fits the character very well. Kaoru Yachigusa as Miss Marple does equally well and together really are the anchors of the show (as they should be) No English dub available, but it would be hard to compete with the performances of David Suchet and the late Joan Hickson, who owned the roles in their respected, live-action, adaptations. 
 
A series like this tough to rate. The watered down nature of the show is to make it as kid friendly as possible, but the purist in me wanted something a bit more mature and accurate. But, I liked it nonetheless. It doesn't cover every one of Poirot and Marple's works, that would be very difficult given some of the subject matter and the target audience, but that also gives viewers something to seek out on their own and start reading. You get so many Anime shows as bait to read the Manga, (there is one for this show, btw.) here is one that might inspire kids to pick up a classic book. And that's admirable. It's like mystery candy. Marketed to kids, but still just as enjoyable for grown-ups. Cheers!  

          
 
       Helpful ""No mystery is unsolvable. Truth smiles upon me!"" 
 
I feel it very necessary to say, I have not yet read anything written by Agatha Christie. I have no doubt that the original books were superior to this adaptation, and I can tell just from watching the show that the stories had an excellent source material. The main question for Christie fans will probably be, ""How much adaptation decay is there?"" I cannot answer this, only talk about how I felt as someone who was experiencing everything in this show as fresh and new. 
 
In part to provide a common link between Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, the lead detectives of our story, and also in part to give children a character with which to relate, we are introduced to Maybelle West, a 16-year old girl who is learning how to become a detective. Maybelle also comes along with the unfortunate companion of Oliver the duckling. Maybelle, when she's not being a horrible brat to her father, is mostly smiling and friendly and vapid. Fortunately, she doesn't intrude on the established stories very much. She assists Poirot and Marple, but I often times forget she is there. Oliver is harder to ignore, because when he pops his head out of his basket, the camera is squarely on him until he disappears. Oliver gets far too much screentime for a creature with zero purpose other than to be adorable. 
 
If like me you haven't read these stories before, don't think you won't be fooled just because this is a ""kid's show."" Yes, sometimes they add in extra clues, but for the most part these are riddles that will challenge an adult mind. Sometimes I correctly guessed a culprit and reasoned through it, and sometimes I didn't. That's probably the genius of Agatha Christie shining through. 
 
At the heart and despite all the trimmings, this show is classic ""whodunnit,"" with an ample side dish of ""howdunnit."" Marple and Poirot are both the kind of people who prefer to solve a crime with deduction than following breadcrumbs. So, instead of a crime story where breaks and new leads in the case are handed to us, we as viewers have to slowly gather facts and read suspects. There is almost zero action in this show, and that is just fine, because it kept my brain chugging along. The suspense is good enough to cut with a knife. 
 
While the animation screams ""low budget,"" it doesn't really hamper the show as there's no action to be animated anyway. A positive and surprising tip of the hat should go to the soundtrack, which I felt heightened the show quite a bit, including the OP. It's more than I would have expected for a show of this type. 
 
Despite the simplicity of all the main characters, Marple and Poirot included, and the younger audience wrapping, there is a distinct satisfaction that I got from watching this show and trying to figure out how the bad guy did it, whether I'm right or wrong. Some of the cases are brilliant, and it's easier to watch four episodes than it is to read a novel (if you're the lazy type). You do not need a background of reading Christie stories to appreciate the mystery. The show actually has made me want to go to the bookstore and check out some of Agatha Christie's other work. So while certainly not perfect in translation, the core of this anime was solid enough for a fully grown adult like myself to enjoy watching it.

          
 
       Helpful In 1841, when Edgar Allen Poe wrote ※The Murders in the Rue Morgue§ and introduced readers to the detective C. Auguste Dupin he helped create a genre of fiction that has endured and thrived in the decades since, and I＊m glad he did.  I do love detective stories.  It＊s the reason I watch Law & Order reruns every night as well as being part of the reason I＊ve watched over 200 episodes of Detective Conan to date.  The thrill of the hunt for the killer, the match of wits and intellect between detective, murderer, and perhaps even reader are hallmarks of a good detective story.  Among my favorite writers in the genre is Agatha Christie and consequently one of my favorite detectives is her charming Belgian dandy Hercule Poirot.  Having read Poirot novels and seen the superb Granada television series starring David Suchet it was only a matter of time before I dove into the Poirot anime.  Indeed, I did just that this past autumn with mixed results. 
 
Before any conclusions can be reached it is best to always lay the facts out in front of us as they are.  Agatha Christie no Meitante Poirot to Marple is a thirty-nine episode long television series that adapts various novels and short stories featuring Christie＊s detectives Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple.  Some mysteries are solved in the space of a single episode while others take significantly longer with novel adaptations usually running for four episodes at the most.  It sounds like a good setup and could potentially work very well but problems arise at the start of the very first episode where it is revealed that while the names Poirot and Marple are prominently featured in the title and while both detectives are characterized fairly well this isn＊t really their story.  No, this is the story of young Mabel West and her pet duck Oliver as they (yes they) learn about detective work from these two thoroughly qualified mentors.   
 
Mabel desires independence, to find her own path in life free from her father＊s overbearing influence and expectations, a desire that eventually leads her to seek a position as an assistant to Poirot.  That＊s all well and good I suppose but the problem is that her father＊s supposed controlling nature is never properly established.  The height of his onscreen tyranny is when he quite understandably chastises Mabel for bringing her pet duck into a crowded ballroom in the first episode.  Beyond that there is the point that he insists on her going to a supposedly unpleasant boarding school, a potentially good line to follow up on.  The creators would have done well to open the story at the boarding school, showing the viewer what a stultifying environment it really is in order to make Mabel＊s perspective more readily understandable.  Unfortunately they don＊t and the only reason Mr. West is overbearing is because Mabel says he is.   
 
However, while Mabel is indeed a poor character I can＊t entirely dismiss her.  While she is an obvious ploy by the creators to draw in a younger audience through the experiences of a similarly aged original character she spends most of her time in the background, never becoming intrusive and getting in the way of the story.  Indeed, the most valueable role Mabel plays is that of a plot device to connect the worlds of Poirot and Marple.  In the end the worst the creators have done by introducing the Mabel character is merely to take the Watson role of Captain Hastings and divide it up between two characters.   
 
No, the worst transgression that the creators of this television program committed is related to another character entirely.  This is a character so utterly useless in the context of a murder/mystery program, so cynically placed that the sheer gall of the creators is mind-boggling.  I am of course talking about Mabel＊s damned pet duck Oliver, a pseudo-anthropomorphized little yellow duck who looks, for all intents and purposes, like he wandered into the murder/mystery show out of a Walt Disney film.  Oliver＊s sole function, his singular purpose in being inserted into the world of Agatha Christie is to be a cute little duck that the viewers can look at and marvel at how cute he is to the point that he actually gets in the way.  There are moments where the mystery that the show is supposed to be about is shelved so Oliver can pop out of the wicker basket Mabel carries him around in like an all too cute jack-in-the-box so he can sit in the lap of and be fawned over by whichever character happens to be around at the time.  The height of his hideousness comes when during one particular case Oliver actually finds the murder weapon, receives credit for it, and tears off the murderer's disguise.  It all gives the impression of a production process where the creators had their priorities terribly confused. 
 
On the story front the best I can say is that the adaptations of Christie found in Poirot to Marple are adequate and that＊s all.  While various blunders hinder the production (among them a rather pointless escape from a French port under gunfire) and a good deal of the mystery has been drained out of these mysteries the essential quality of Christie＊s writing does manage to somehow work its way through in the end making these acceptable but nonetheless flawed adaptations.  The animation is similarly adequate but a good deal more bland.  Character designs are as generic as they come with a minimum of detail accompanied by a flat color scheme all around.  The only area where Poirot to Marple truly succeeds is in its soundtrack which can be often quite effective. 
 
However, despite a well utilized soundtrack I can only recommend this show as a potential child＊s diversion (in which case it has the unfortunate potential to ruin the experience of Christie for future readers) or as a curious oddity for Christie fans as it was for me.  If you＊ve already seen the Granada Poirot television series, or better still actually read Christie yourself, rest assured you＊ve already had the superior experience as both are far superior in terms of characterization, wit, suspense, and most importantly mystery.

This is beyond better than that Gintama garbage. laughed my ass off (especially in ep. 10 the strawberry sundae part. I don't know why but I got tears from laughing so much.) That Akutabe dude is one helluva awesome guy. I love sadistic characters, really entertaining.  
 
Everyone should give it a try, reviews and recommends ain't important. If you hesitate, you should def watch it. It's been so long since I laughed so much after Beelzebub and Yankee-kun Megane-chan

       Helpful §Yondemasu-yo, Azazel-san§ is a comedy anime by Production I.G, known for Ghost in the Shell and Kimi ni Todoke, amongst others.  
 
The premise is pretty simple, but very functional. A detective called Akutabe summons a demon named Azazel, and the story follows him, his assistant Sakuma, and their various demon helpers as they solve cases and engage in depravity and lasciviousness.  
Because the humor ranges from mild to Detroit Metal City-level swearing, visually almost grotesque gags, and numerous mentions of bodily waste. All the demons (unsurprisingly) have some sort of perverse gimmick or vice, and the show pulls no punches when it comes to exploiting these.  
Compared to the only other I.G comedy I have seen, Cromartie High School, the humor is very different, though that mostly has to do with the source material. I have not read the manga, nor have I been able to locate it, but I think the anime does a pretty good job on its own of delivering a story that at a few points made me surprised at how involved I had become. Still, it＊s nothing to write home about for the most part, but the humor, though juvenile, is great. 
The shortness of the episodes make it good for sporadic watching, and I joined in late, but marathonned the first five episodes without noticing it. 
 
The animation is mostly decent, with a couple of scenes with slightly above average fluidity. What makes the show stand out a little, though, is the overall design and expression of the characters. It＊s very similar to Sgt. Frog in its simplicity, and while there is not much detail in the appearance of the characters, their over-the-top reactions and facial mimicry reinforce the gags, and do an effective job of bringing the characters to life. 
 
The other thing that brings them to life is the voice acting. The show has a great cast, featuring Kobayashi Yuu (Undine), Nakai Kazuya (Salamander), Kamiya Hiroshi (eBeelzebub) and Namikawa Daisuke (Akutabe). They all give it their best, and do a wonderful job of giving the characters identity, making them lovable (or even more detestable) and they all fit their roles like a hand fits a glove. 
 
If you＊re of the opinion that all anime needs to have at least two subtle messages hidden in the plot, and that comedy you don＊t consider high-brow is worthless, then you should not watch this. If you liked for example Detroit Metal City or Panty & Stocking (with Garterbelt), then you would probably like this. For everybody else, you＊re likely to get a couple of chuckles out of it.

          
 
       Helpful Alot of Japanese comedy anime, revolve around play on words and it is hard sometimes to truly get the full benefit of a the of anime with just the english subtitles. However this is not the case with yondemasu yo azazel san. I was laughing out loud, the thing I was most disappointed in was the fact that each episode was only 13 minutes. 
 
The characters are hilarious, the demons are all very unique and all have their own problems and input into the show. Where can you go wrong with a demon in the form of a penguin who eats shit. From the first episode if you don't like the humor then you probably won't like the entire series since it focuses on the crude and obscene. 
 
Akutabe is the mysterious detective that has somehow managed to obtained contracts of pretty much every demon. He seems to also have no weakness and treats the demons he has made contracts with cruelly, cruelly is actually probably to nice a word.  
 
The art worked very with the overall them of the series not to flashy but enough detail to show they put in some effort. If you liked Detroit metal city then this is probably your kind of anime.

It is an anime produced by Madhouse that aired from October 2, 2007 until March 25, 2008. It has as genres, Mystery, Comedy, Demons, Supernatural and Shounen. 
 
Story:  
Being an anime of related genres, like Mystery, Comedy, Demons, Supernatural and Shounen, is VERY unique. Basically, the story revolves around two main characters, Katsuragi Yako, a high school girl who starts getting excited about solving mysteries (in Anime, later she begins to be recognized as ""The Female High School Detective"") and Nougami Neuro, a DETECTIVE demon from hell. The story of the two begins with Yako's encounter with Neuro, the moment Yako sees his father dead in his room, his father's case seems unsolvable and without proving that the police accuse Yako's father of suicide, so Yako thinks IMPROVABLE the suicide of his father, Neuro appears and speaks says he is a DETECTIVE from hell who can help you find a solution to your father's case, then the ""journey"" of the two detectives begins. 
 
Characters:  
So the characters in Anime are COMPLETELY COOL, OMG!, all are incredible, extremely funny, and extremely WELL explored.(I will focus on the two main characters as they are the ones I liked the most). 
 
Nougami Neuro: Nougami Neuro: An extremely talented, sadistic, funny and a little scary detective. Even Neuro being a demon, his looks and clothes are extremely incredible, his personality has given me lots of laughter and moments of fun. One of my favorite characters among all Animes 
 
Katsuragi Yako: Ah, what to talk about Yako-san, an extremely funny and cute character. So her relationship with Neuro is extremely well done in the anime course, and my God, she's really cool and has a fascinating personality. It will surely stay somewhere in my heart. 
 
Conclusion: 
Well directed by Hiroshi Koujinaq and produced by Madhouse, Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is an extremely captivating and interesting Anime to watch. I'm watching him on vacation, as I have more time left to amuse myself watching Animes, Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro appeared, and I do not regret to having started to watch, is an extremely good Anime and I recommend to everyone who has curiosity in animes of this genre .  
It is one of my personal FAVORITES.

          
 
       Helpful I can't see why people would think this show is bad at all. 
 
It's animated by the same studio that did Death Note, it's incredibly unique, and it's fun to watch. 
 
The manga volumes I have read are incredibly random, but incredibly entertaining and genius, and although the Anime is quite dumbed down and rearranged, there have been no fillers; Although the story has been changed quite a bit. 
 
The show has sadly been one of the series to not be subbed regularly, I was glad when catchphrase picked it up and they did it well, but then they slowed down. Now I'm watching Ainex's releases and they do a really good job, like they do with Persona -Trinity Soul- and how they did with Night Wizard. They are usually the first one out and have good visual quality and subbing accuracy. 
 
I would recommend anybody who likes Anime to at least try this series, I know I usually overrate what I watch, but this series definitely deserves a 9.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Basically a demon detective, Neuro, comes to the human world from hell and teams up with a girl, Yako, whose father was murdered. Basically the story is then done is a mostly episodic manner, that is every episodes, sometimes every 2-3 episodes, are a new case. But as you progress through the cases and the episodes, you witness a lot of growth with Yako and in the end the mystery of her father's death is obviously resolved. The cases aren't really always that great and are usually pretty easy in terms of solving and predicting, but there's some nice ones, and either way, the cases are still enjoyable. The whole supernatural aspect of it makes it take a different approach than most detective and mystery shows, which I think is good. 
 
Art: 
The artwork and animation was very nice. The close-ups on Neuro's eyes  and face were always spectacular because they displayed so much detail, but then there would be other scenes where his face would then have a really simple and comedic look at the right situations, which was good. There's also some pretty good angles and visual effects to accompany it all. 
 
Sound: 
The OP is a cool song by Nightmare (same band that did 1st Death Note OP,) which I think a lot of people, including myself, enjoyed. The ED was a nice soft song that always ended the episode nicely. The sound effects and background aren't anything special really, but by no means bad. That goes for the voice acting as well. 
 
Character: 
Neuro is an awesome character...just had to say that first. Anyway, yeah, I think the cast is pretty good. You got this demon detective straight out of hell that uses these cool techniques (777 tools of the underworld) and is pretty damn strong, and a school girl whose greatest love is eating and food and isn't really a good detective at all, yet gains fame as a detective, however she understands human ways very well, which makes her a good asset to Neuro. Then there's the other characters like Godai, Sasazuka, Ishigaki, who all are pretty likable. And then the line-up of criminals and murderers, particularly Sai, who I won't mention much on because I don't wanna spoil anything. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Well, like I said, the murder cases aren't that great, but the supernatural element of it makes the cases still pretty enjoyable. There's some good action here and there, mostly fighting between Neuro and Sai. There's plenty of blood to go around, so if you particularly like that, this won't let you down. And lastly, it is also quite humorous at times, especially when Neuro purposely degenerates Yako and Godai.

","I imagine if you're reading this review you've already seen the other two seasons of Bungou Stray Dogs, if not I recommend you stop reading this and go watch them... 
Dead Apple was definitely a great movie that told the story of 3 different masterminds each with their own goals, but all of them shared one thing...boredom, and in this movie our protagonist Nakajima Atsushi manages to finally find some closure for himself and his ability. 
 
Story (10): The story was depicted beautifully in my eyes considering they had only an hour and thirty minutes to do so and not 12-24 episodes, by giving us some initial context to the events that happened 6 years prior to this story we understand the reasons and motives that drive our characters, it allows even people who haven't seen the previous anime seasons to be able to follow along and understand what is happening more or less, and without spoiling too much my personal favorite couple Nakajima Atsushi and Izumi Kyouka finally manage to overcome some of the psychological barriers that held them back. 
 
Art (9): The Art style here is by far one of my absolute favorites, because it doesn't try to be too ""cute"" if you get what I mean but at the same time giving our characters just the right balance between ""cute and attractive"" and ""intimidating and bad ass""... As to the animations they were definitely top notch, I didn't really notice any off-putting motions or effects overall, and everything felt smooth and natural. 
 
Sound (8): I absolutely loved the music in this movie, everything from the opening song at the start to the background music during the fights, it was all just my kind of music. The voice acting was good but at certain scenes felt a bit off although not so much that it it looked bad or out of place but I thought I'd mention it. 
 
Character (10): As always the characters in Bungou Stray Dogs are some of the best I've ever seen in terms of depth and progression... We have the crafty Dazai who always surprises us with his unexpected methods and wits, Nakahara who's Dazai's old partner who on the outside sounds like he hates Dazai, but in fact they trust each other with their lives, Akutagawa who's always trying to prove his strength to those around him, Nakajima who has more potential than anyone but doesn't like to hurt people and is often seen as a coward, and these are just some of the entertaining characters out of several more and each of their pasts and motives are explained properly whether through this movie or the anime, but like I said before, if you haven't seen the anime you shouldn't be watching this. 
 
Enjoyment (9): Overall I'd say I definitely enjoyed this movie more than I should have but maybe that's just because I'm a fan of the series, Dead Apple was a really enjoyable experience and I think anyone who enjoyed the anime wouldn't say no to this, I give it 8/10.

          
 
       Helpful I don't normally give out 9-star ratings, but this movie deserved it. It's mostly biased from the actual series from before, but that would make sense as this movie is a ""sequel"" to that in a sense. I loved this movie, the character development wasn't the best, but it was great; the main reason I gave out this score was the ending. Not only was it the same as the actual series of Bungo Stray Dogs, but it gave out a deeper meaning of the same theme/moral. 
 
This movie is themed around the fact that people will always help those in need, and that humans will always save what they believe is important to them, even if it means overcoming the past and looking over regrets. Without spoiling it too much, everyone is protecting Yokohama City, from the criminals, to the government, to the Armed Detectives Agency. All of them ""hate"" each other in a sense, and there's always something keeping them apart, especially how one is for evil, one is management, and one is for justice. In the end, they all team up and still protect what they cherish. 
 
Dazai might have been the star of this show, but we also see Atsuhi-kun overcoming his past, as he opens the door to the future and learns the truth to whom he is. He finally accepts who he is and becomes one with himself. Chuya and Dazai are enemies from not only their side and opinions, but from past events. This movie shows the trust between two friends no matter how far apart they may go apart (as you see when Chuya uses Corruption knowing only Dazai can stop him, even though they're enemies). 
 
This movie ended in a fast paced manner, but I enjoyed it, and enjoyed it a lot. The ending theme, the sense of satisfaction you get, and the realization that humans will always protect whom they love, the places they cherish, and will ditch all or any past behind them to do so, gave me a thriller. From a sound-perspective, the soundtrack was amazing and the placing of the original ending theme at the final battle was amazing in my opinion, the placement of the new ending theme was also perfect along with that final cutscene that shows the ""and so they lived on happily ever after"" type ending. 
 
I gave this movie a 9/10 because it is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece I've seen in quite a while. If you read this, you should watch the main series, and also watch this movie right after. It gave me a new outlook on life and my opinions on the separate character's personalities.

          
 
       Helpful i made this based on my personal opinion, sorry if it doesn't match your taste. also you better not read this if you haven't watch the movie because im afraid i might spill some spoiler. 
 
for me they better make a season 3 rather than this movie, seriously its a waste. there are a lot of scenes going on in the movie that are unnecessary, especially that incident with atsushi's past. we already know that atsushi has managed to deal with his anxiety in the previous series but then somehow they come up with more anxiety again that we already so done with. also the villain's motive to make yokohama into chaos and put all people in danger is too weak. like, doesn't he has a better excuse to destroy a town? he looks just so lame at the end. and of course the way atsushi blindly believe in dazai but others don't is so unclear for me, they should make a better explanation. there are also some gaps among several events that need to be cleared. 
 
but despite the main protagonist and antagonist i actually enjoy the other characters more in this movie like chuuya, dazai, akutagawa, fyodor, and somehow kyoka. they managed to blur the vagueness between atsushi and shibusawa to bring the excitement and make me enjoy this movie at the end.

The client also reveals that the wristbands given to Ran and company are set to detonate should they leave the premises. The mystery man reveals that two other detectives gave up, one killed, while one is still working.
Conan and Kogoro investigate an empty hotel where they find ski masks and a gun, which were used for a robbery. On the same date of the robbery, Kaitou Kid stole some jewels from a nearby company. Kogoro retrieves the bag, but ends up getting arrested as Kid's accomplice. The mysterious man calls Conan, correctly identifies him as Shinichi and gives him a second clue.
Conan meets Heiji Hattori who reveals that he is also part of the search, with his friend Kazuha also held captive. Hattori and Conan work together and end up in Yokohama Ocean University where they join together with Hakuba Saguru, a famous detective from the North. They find out that one of the former presidents of the club, Nishio, was charged with the murder of a classmate. Hattori then confirms with the client through the phone that the mystery he wants them to solve was the murder case.
They are attacked by two motorcyclists working for a person who is trying to kill Kaitou Kid. To escape, the three detectives split up. Conan ends up falling from a bridge and breaks his leg.
Kogoro is already giving his report to the client in the hotel when Hattori knocks him out so he does not get killed for giving a wrong conclusion. They then discover the client who is a blind wheelchair user and reveal the truth to him. The client, Nishio and Reiko, a woman who the client was in love with, were staging the robbery of an armored car. The robbery went wrong when a guard was killed and the robbers' escape was then witnessed by Kaitou Kid. Thus, the Nishio was murdered in order to keep the involvement of the other two silent. Conan and Hattori reveal that Nishio was already dead before the client shot him and that Reiko was the true killer. When the client panicked and tried to leave the city, his car was sabotaged in an attempt to kill him.
Reiko appears at that moment and confirms the truth behind the incident. She attempts to kill the detectives but is knocked out.
Conan accesses the computer to change the settings on the wristbands but fails due to the computer receiving damage from a loose gunshot. Conan manages to deactivate the link but not the restricted area however. The watches are then collected by the police except one (Genta) which is not accounted for as the police thought that the number of wristband is correct. They forgot to include the fact that Sonoko Suzuki is not involved in the case therefore they should include one more in the number of wristband collected. After the police collected the wristbands, all of them went to the snake ride. Genta brought along the wristband for the snake ride. At the start of the ride, Hattori saw the wristband and shouted. Haibara managed to remove but due to the motion of the ride, the wristband lands on the last seat of the ride. When the ride reaches the sea which is out of the restricted zone, Kaitou Kid took the wristband and let it explode safely.
Conan reveals that Kid was with them for a long time, disguised as Hakuba Saguru. The death of the three previous detectives hired by the client is revealed to have been staged.
","This movie is probably the most questionable in the entire series. It's so questionable, I don't know if I can even call it a movie. It's more like a TV special made to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise, but ended up being turned into a movie instead. As much as this movie may have its fans, Detective Conan: Requiem of the Detectives fails to impress as not only an anniversary film, but a film in general. 
 
The only saving grace about this movie is its story, which has Conan and the other detectives try to solve a case for a client before they all explode. There is some semblance of a looming sense of dread, as every moment is leading closer and closer to death as the movie goes on. There are even a few decent character moments here and there. Of course, this is where the praise for this movie stops. 
 
While the story itself is good, the execution is extremely lacking. Despite being under pressure to solve a case as soon as possible, the way the scenes are shot fail to capture that urgency. Everything feels so slow and plain that it eliminates any semblance of tension that the characters may be under right now. What also ruins this movie even more is its art and animation. The Detective Conan movies usually have a level of polish that puts them above the anime series. Here, there is no trace of quality or refining done to either the art or animation. It is, quite literary, an extended episode.  
 
If this were a TV special, then I wouldn't mind it so much (then I wouldn't even need to review it). But this isn't just a movie; it's a movie celebrating the 10th anniversary of the series. When put into that context, what does it have going for it? What can you watch in this movie that you can literally see in any other movie? Heiji and Kaito Kid? They already have their own movies. Everyone is going to be killed if Conan doesn't solve the case? Try the Eleventh Striker. Requiem of the Detectives' main problem is how basic it all is; every other movie before and after it did the same things that this movie does but even better. It's almost like this movie only had the story to work with and just did whatever with everything else. 
 
Before I end this review, I do want to stress that this only just me speaking and that my opinion may not apply for everyone else. These movies are like different flavors of ice cream. Some are like chocolate. Some are like strawberry. Some are even like pistachio. If I had to define Requiem of the Detectives as an ice cream flavor, it would be vanilla. Not French vanilla or vanilla bean; just basic vanilla. Some people like vanilla and that's okay. Even I'm morbidly curious what maple bacon ice cream tastes like. As such, Requiem of the Detectives will always be somebody else's favorite Detective Conan movie no matter what I think of it.

       Helpful Another great case featuring Shinichi Kudo aka Conan Edogawa. Although the case is a bit prolonged, its story and pace more than makes up for it. First off, a mysterious client asks for Mouri Kogoro (with Ran, Conan and detective boys) to meet at a hotel. There, they were given an electronic wrist strap as a vip entrance to a nearby theme park where they can ride anything for free - on condition that Mouri and Conan will stay and solve the case. It gets more interesting as the two meet up with Hattori and other detectives, only to discover that all of them are in the same predicament -- solve the case or the people they love will die! Its a fast-pace adventure as both conan, hattori, and mouri (he's serious for once, aww) race ahead of time to save their loved ones in the theme park.

16,235,24,7.213187685,Detective and his or her helper,Detective Conan (TV),"Shinichi Kudou, a high school student of astounding talent in detective work, is well known for having solved several challenging cases. One day, when Shinichi spots two suspicious men and decides to follow them, he inadvertently becomes witness to a disturbing illegal activity. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act, so the men dose him with an experimental drug formulated by their criminal organization, leaving him to his death. However, to his own astonishment, Shinichi lives to see another day, but now in the body of a seven-year-old child. 
 
Perfectly preserving his original intelligence, he hides his real identity from everyone, including his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father, private detective Kogorou Mouri. To this end, he takes on the alias of Conan Edogawa, inspired by the mystery writers Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa. 
 
 Detective Conan  follows Shinichi who, as Conan, starts secretly solving the senior Mouri's cases from behind the scenes with his still exceptional sleuthing skills, while covertly investigating the organization responsible for his current state, hoping to reverse the drug's effects someday. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']","Jimmy Kudo (Japanese name: Shinichi Kudo) is a high school detective who sometimes works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is ambushed and incapacitated by a member of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. In an attempt to murder the young detective, they force-fed him a dangerous experimental drug. However, instead of killing him, it turns him into a kid. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases. Nonetheless, after Kudo solves one, he will use Dr. Agasa's hidden tranquilizer to sedate Richard and then uses a voice changer to simulate his voice to reveal the solution. He also enrolls in Teitan Elementary School where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective Club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with other characters, including his neighbor, Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena Sebastian (Sonoko Suzuki), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), assorted police detectives from different regions, and a phantom thief called the Kaito Kid.
Kudo later encounters an elementary school transfer student, Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), who reveals herself to be a former member of the Black Organization under the code name ""Sherry"" and the creator of the experimental drug that shrunk him. She too had ingested it to evade the pursuit of the organization. She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy.
","I guess you can say that Detective Conan is what got me into anime. It changed my view of the world of animation and is also responsible for the dark circles under my eyes when i go on a DC marathon. Anyways, having watched every episode and every OVA and every movie, I can tell you that some episodes are great. Some are not. 
 
When I talk about detective Conan episodes I usually judge them based on 1. Plot. The murder/theft/fake accident/pretend locked room etc. and how well the characters reacted as well as the extremity of the whole thing. I like dramatic episodes. And 2.The characters. Come on, if you're like me and you've watched over 600 of these tales, you begin to develop favorites. These are the characters that seems to come and go with awesome stories. Heiji, shinichi (norm size), his parents, takagi et saito, Kaito, and of course, the much dreaded black organization. Hope y'all felt the sarcasm there. Is it really necessary for Conan to go into a daydream and introduce us to the organization each time they're brought up as if we're new audiences? Seriously. 
 
Personally I enjoyed the first 300 episodes the best. They were innovative and fun to watch. As the years went by, I pitied the writers for their hard attempt at thinking of possible crimes left they haven't made an episode out of yet. In recent episodes, the plot seem repetitive and the kids are showing up more! Arggg!!! 
 
Cheers for over 600 episodes and 16 movies and more to come! 

          
 
       Helpful Detective Conan is beyond your average detective anime. What i mean ""beyond your average"" is that it definitely got ""everything"" in it. Likely said, it has the funny moments (Humors), it got also Love story (Romance),the Drama, silce of life they do have the very unique plots of stories some are based on the Mysteries (we have know of) and that you will soon know through watching the series, It will give you the thrills and chills because its more than just the crime scene or solving crime since there are storyline which people called arcs. It also let us know more of japan's culture and traditions, you could learn japanese as well (yeah, this is the only anime which i learn/know alot of japanese more than any other animes). You would know also the life of occupations of people in real life and for the overall, as the anime progresses it really gives you the satisfaction (even have movies,ovas,specials and magic files).  
 
What's more fun about it, is that you can exercise your detective skills on who is the culprit on this case. If you got it right, thats a job well done for you and if not, you will get to improve yourself more and more.  
 
The Story follows the adventures of Shinichi Kudo (also known as Jimmy Kudo in Case Closed) a Prodigious young detective who was inadvertently transformed into a child due to poison.

And instead of dying because of that poison, it he made him shrinks down to the size of a seven year old.

He will be renaming himself Edogawa Conan to hide his identity in order to protect his beloved ones. He later moves into Ran and Mouri Kogoro.  
 
Even as Conan, he still continues in solving cases one after the other, He help build up Kogoro's reputation in hoping to find cases related to the syndicate called the Black Organization, who were responsible for his transformation in the first place.

Sparrow called the style of the series a mix of Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes, while Chavez believed the manga had appeal to readers of all ages.[157][158] The series ranked on About.com's top continuing manga series of 2010, under the title ""Best Underappreciated Gem: Shonen"" category.[159] 
 
The animated adaptation of the series was also popular in Japan, appearing in the top six of Japanese TV Rankings at various times.[160][161] The television series ranked among the top twenty in polls conducted by anime magazine Animage from 1996 to 2001.[162][163][164][165][166][167][168] It also placed better than twenty-third in polls for the Top 100 anime conducted by Japanese television network TV Asahi in 2005每06.[169][170][171] The series received considerable airtime in China; it was the second most broadcast animation there in 2004.[172] Several of the franchise's films were nominated for awards in their home country.

Melissa Sternenberg from THEM Anime Reviews reviewed and praised its animation and plot.[179] ActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character design and the ""spirit"" that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience.[180][181] In the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for North American audiences. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change the names of the characters, and Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical.[182][183] The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of Case Closed for Anime News Network; he said that while the main characters sounded like ""real people"", the secondary ones ""[came] off as caricatures"".[184] Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described Case Closed as ""a clever series that had mysteries at every corner"", noting the ""bizarre"" and ""interesting"" nature of each case.[185] IGN's Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries. He described the series as ""Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style.""[186] His colleague, Harris, however, expressed annoyance with repetitive elements in the show and the contrived methods the series uses to keep Conan's identity a secret from certain characters.[182] 
 
In 2006, the Japanese government used Conan in campaigns to help promote crime awareness among children.[187] Targeting the same audience, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs used Conan and his friends in two pamphlets: one to promote the ministry's mission, the other to introduce the 34th G8 summit held in the country in 2010.[188][189][190][191] Several characters in the series featured in the sixth installment of the Anime, Heroes and Heroines commemorative stamp series issued by Japan Post in 2006.[192] Aoyama and his creations are celebrated in his hometown Hokuei, Tottori; a museum with exhibits of his work is located there, and several bronze statues of Jimmy Kudo, Conan Edogawa, and Rachel Moore are installed in various locations throughout the town.[193][194][195][196][197] It also has other tourist attractions related to Detective Conan, including a Detective Conan themed airport and train station, and it is promoted as Conan Town.[198] 
 
Licensed merchandise based on Detective Conan are sold in Asia. In Japan, Detective Conan licensed merchandise sold ?2.89 billion in 2003, ?17.29 billion during 2005每2008, and ?9.03 billion during 2010每2012, adding up to at least ?29.21 billion ($366.09 million) sold in Japan between 2003 and 2012.[199] In 2018, Detective Conan caught the attention of American late night talk show host Conan O'Brien, who discussed the character Detective Conan as well as Conan Town in his talk show Conan,[200] and visited the town in September 2018.[201]. The end.

16,35889,26,7.190457062,Detective and his or her helper,Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens,"Although the city of Fukuoka might look relatively peaceful at first glance, in actuality it houses a thriving mixture of dangerous individuals such as killers, detectives, and professional revenge seekers right beneath its surface. Among their number is Zenji Banba, a laidback and observant detective who is investigating the work of other hitmen companies in the area. However, Banba might not be the only one with a bone to pick with these organizations, as Xianming Lin, a crossdressing male hitman in the employ of one such company begins getting fed up with his lack of jobs and pay. 
 
One day, after Lin's current target commits suicide before the hitman could reach him, his company refuses to pay him even half the amount they were originally supposed to for the assassination. Frustrated, Lin requests another mission and is offered the job of taking out Banba, whom his organization believes has been interfering with their business. However, when Banba arrives at his home and finds the hitman inside, Lin surprisingly doesn't even attempt to kill him. Instead, he offers the detective another option: to join him and form a team. With the offer on the table, exactly how will Banba respond, and just what plans does Lin have in store for the underground world of Fukuoka? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]",['Action'],none,"When I went through the reviews of this anime I noticed an all or none phenomenon. People either loved it or despised it and that made me super curious. And man am I glad that I watched it. 
 
The setting is very idiosyncratic. I mean a world where hitmen casually hung out and discussed their jobs and the people they murdered in public and had baseball teams...uhmm ...weird. But at the same time its pretty interesting if you just ignore the improbability if it. It had a bit of bebop feel to it at times(maybe thats just me though) 
 
The art is good when its good but so very low budget at times. Sound is pretty good too but nothing to rave about. 
 
Now what made the story so so so very enjoyable for me were the characters. All of them are ridiculously quirky with amazing lgbt representation(for a shounen anime). Banba is definitley the hitman with a heart of gold but mess with him or the people he cares about and we see a totally different side of him. Lin is amazing. I dont think ive seen any non shoujo anime where a cross dresser is the lead but i seriously loved him. He met banba at a terrible point in time and slowly learns to trust him again. all the side characters were pretty intersting too especially the avengers. I felt there was solid chemistry between lin and banba but at the same time it leaves their relationship to the viewers imagination ( totally domestic newlyweds in my opinion). Very few female characters though 
 
 
This anime certainly has its flaws but i think the charm outweighs it. Id definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a fun anime watching experience 
 


          
 
       Helpful Story 7 / 10: 
 
The story was entertaining enough that it kept my attention, but I do admit that there were moments when it seemed a bit jumpy with sudden throw ins of certain things. That said, the story was MOSTLY well kept together and was enjoyable nonetheless. 
 
Art 5 / 10: 
 
Truthfully the art wasn't anything special for me. It was average. Nothing overly appealing, but not the worst I've ever seen either. 
 
Sound 5 / 10 
 
I feel the same about the sound as I do with the art. I didn't really care much about the op or ed and I feel similarly with the soundtrack. There wasn't anything that I wanted to listen to over and over again. It was just music, but not music I particularly cared about or hated. 
 
Character 7 / 10 
 
I have to say there were some characters that I really loved an enjoyed while there were others that I liked but didn't think too much of. There were a lot of characters that just showed up every once in a while that I didn't care much for but I didn't hate either. Lin and Banba's relationship was very enjoyable for me, but they were also the most entertaining characters for me with Lin being my favorite overall. I think learning about Lin's past was quite nice too and I hadn't expected the show to delve into that so it was a nice surprise that made him more enjoyable for me. 
 
Enjoyment 8 / 10 
 
Despite what I've said so far, Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens was definitely a show I was excited for weekly. I wanted to see it come around week by week and I'm definitely glad I continued with it up until the very end because I can definitely say it was worth my time. 
 
Overall 8 / 10 
 
At the end of the day this show gets an 8 because while some factors of it may not be particularly special, I enjoyed it enough that I can't possibly rate it any lower than an 8. I would definitely recommend it to others and I would watch it again maybe once more just because I enjoyed the characters I liked so much. It's going to be a series that I'll miss quite a bit now that it's over.

          
 
       Helpful First off, if you think this is a show about ramen noodles then nope, best looking elsewhere. It's a trap. 
 
The Hakata prefecture in Fukuoka was famous for its Tonkotsu ramen and looks like your regular city but it had its own underworld where 3% of its population were killers for hire. Some called themselves ""avengers"", people who can be hired to get revenge for their clients. Baseball loving Zenji Banba is a private detective out investigating a murder of a fellow detective who was murdered by a local hitman. As such, he also ends up being targeted for nosying around. Rash Lin Xianming on the other hand, is a highly skilled hitman who had sold himself off as a kid so that his family could live a better life. Now he was trying to buy his freedom back from a Taiwanese gang so that he can return home to his sister and ends up being assigned to the job. However, he refuses and decides to protect Zenji instead - at least, until he gets paid properly. Laid back Zenji goes with the flow and it just so happens Lin was part of the organisation he was investigating. When Lin's sister ends up abused and killed by the very same gang, they end up working together and Lin ends up seeing a different side of the underworld including a close encounter with the Niwaka Samurai, a hitman that kills hitmen. 
 
Background art's quite good at times while others they over diffuse the lighting so much they look overly blurred. Otherwise the overall quality of the show stays consistent even though it's not great. As far as presentation goes, I think the instrumental pieces of the OST is the best part of this show including the upbeat ending theme, ""Dirty Bullet"". 
 
I assume the show got it's silly name from Zenji's favourite food, instant Hakata Tonkotsu ramen which is about the only thing linked to ramen. As if the title itself wasn't enough to hint at it being a bit of a silly show about the life of underworld criminals, they throw in a cross-dressing hitman and a kind of superhero who goes around slaying hitmen just to be sure so don't expect a Black Lagoon. In a way it kind of reminded me of Samurai Flamenco because the characters all have the same silly, easy going personality as they fight crime dressed up except here, they're not playing superheroes or fighting the supernatural. Instead, it's mostly a group of criminals who end up being the good guys. This show can be a lot more violent too where people are mercilessly tortured or killed with lots of blood and some gore. Even then they can still laugh and joke as they are surrounded by corpses. Of course, you also end up with brief scenes involving the abuse and exploitation of ladies. It's not a show for the young audience that's for sure. 
 
Instead of going for your usual cast of cliche Anime personalities it feels like the show just tries to make all the main characters look cool with the only exception of Lin. It's a character driven show since it's fairly much lacking a main plot and for the most part you're watching how Lin finds a place in his new circle of friends. When the show's not busy slaughtering people it does have it's fun moments as the gang spends time playing baseball matches together or, when you watch the odd relationship between Zenji and Lin playout. Even though everyone's buddy, buddies some don't hesitate to sell each other out when their professional career in the underworld calls for it. Eventually you get some more insight into the character's pasts too. Well... One or two of them anyway. 
 
I think the show does a fair job of bringing characters together through coincidence with only 12 episodes to do it in although I don't know how faithful it is to the 8 volume light novel series. In that regard I think a show like Durarara or Baccano pulls it off much better with its alternating POVs and equally silly characters. Funnily enough the original author Chikai Kisaki did do a collaboration with Ryougo Narita, the author of those two titles at one point, ""Durarara x Hakata Tonkotsu Ramens"". 
 
If you like action character driven shows with a laid back cast and don't mind the underworld violence you might like this. There's the odd episode with extra scenes after the credits so don't miss out.

","This was a pretty interesting OVA. 
 
Despite the lack of any mystery in the story, I still thought this was a pretty interesting one in terms of the characters, and seeing how this what-if scenario plays out is a pretty intriguing concept to begin with, however, there's not really much depth to the actual story. 
 
The main focus really are the characters, which end up feeling similar to their younger selves, but also feel just different enough that you feel like ten years actually have passed. The changes are subtle, but they are there, and it was enough to keep me intrigued throughout. 
 
The art and sound design is about what you'd expect, and is on par with the quality of the TV series in 2009. No surprises here. 
 
Overall, this was an interesting, yet somewhat flawed OVA that had a lot of wasted potential, due to the inconsequential and uneventful nature of the story, but still ultimately ended up being somewhat interesting, especially if you are very interested in these characters.

Along w/ Sara & Souju, his live-in identical twin assistants. He ends up running afoul of the local Yakuza. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Futakoi Alternative tells the story of Rentar身 Futaba and his detective agency. One day a set of twins, Sara and S身ju, show up at his doorstep. They move in with him and work as secretaries for his agency.

Classifying Futakoi Alternative as a specific genre is extremely difficult, although at its core, it is most similar to a romantic comedy. The first handful of episodes are lighthearted, but the series becomes more serious as it approaches its conclusion. The criticisms about the show is normally the same as its accolades: namely, that it never settles completely into any one genre or style and switches between them from episode to episode (being almost equal parts romance, action, scifi/fantasy and comedy). However, it is a love story at its core.
","Well... The original Futakoi was alright in some aspects, but this one was a lot better. It may have been a bit random and some may go 'wtf?' but it gets better as it progresses. 
 
[Story] 
The storyline is about a boy/man/teen w/e called Futaba Rentarou who lives with the twins Sara and Sojyu in an apartment that looks like a bomb shelter. They undertake the wierdest missions in which they find things for clients. The story gets a 7 from me since i only understood half of what they were trying to achieve. The romance between the three gets well underway much later in the anime around the middle, and the first half is mainly setting the story up and 'localizing' you with the characters. 
 
[Art] 
Much better than Futakoi. It seems they took the time and effort to get it right this time round, with the artwork suiting the atmosphere of the anime. 
 
[Sound] 
Hmm.. cant really say its good or bad. I didnt mind any of the audio, but it didnt really captivate me either. 
 
[Character] 
This one goes into some depth with the three main characters and some side characters, such as twin teacher sisters with one of them hiring Rentarou's services to find info on her twin. A so-so effort to develop the characters. 
 
[Enjoyment] 
Reasonably fast-paced action with half of it romance and a bit of humour here and there. If you hated Futakoi, you'll definately like this one better. 
 
[Overall] 
It wouldnt say this was mediocre, but i wouldnt say it was outstanding.

          
 
       Helpful Now, to be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I first laid my eyes on this one. Futakoi didn't impress me and even though I'd heard this was a complete remake with the only similarity being the characters I was far from convinced. However, it would only take the first episode to win me over. 
 
My biggest problem with a lot of anime is that I have to force myself not to fast forward past a lot of scenes. Only a few animes I've seen can pride themselves with having me pay full attention to every scene, and Futakoi alternative is actually one of those! The key to this is a fast paced and unique story. When watching the first episode, I really had no idea where the story was going, but believe me, I wanted to know! Not only this, but the brilliant mix of action and comedy had me wondering where those 20 minutes had gone. The first episode was funny and filled with action provided by colorful characters. Even though I was stunned after the first episode, one question had me worried, would the remaining episodes be as enjoyable? 
 
Don't get me wrong, the first episode's mix of action and comedy was perfect, but action and comedy only goes that far. A good show needs character and story development, and I was wondering whether Futakoi Alternative would provide me with that. However, after watching a few more episodes, this no longer had me worried. The pace was slowed down but instead a solid story replaced it. Even though Futakoi Alternative starts out as a cheerful series, it develops into something deeper, more heart gripping, however, it does all this without losing it's original feel.  
 
Even though the story is brilliant, the characters are in no way to be underestimated. Because believe me when I say this, they are simply great. The main character Rentarou really is one of my favourite anime characters. He's tough and can be hilarious, but he has his inner demons and doubts which makes him into more than a simple harem character. You understand his problems, you know they are hard to solve. I guess you could say he feels REAL. Also, without spoiling too much, it really does feel like this anime wraps things up nicely in the end, something that a lot of good animes fails with. 
 
Futakoi Alternative is a funny action-filled series which manages to maintain a deep, gripping story despite it's unrealistic setting. Comedy, action, drama and romance all together without getting too mixed up. This anime really has it all, I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to see 13 episodes of pure brilliance. 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Futakoi Alternative is a surprisingly engaging show in spite of its bizarre and over-the-top story elements. From what I gather, the series is a spinoff of an anime that is based on a dating sim whose gimmick was a male lead having a harem involving several sets of twin girls attracted to him. While that would seem to make the original Futakoi anime rather forgettable and typical fare, Futakoi Alternative is a whole different beast as it takes many of the characters from the original series and goes in a completely different story direction that mashes up sci-fi action, manic comedy, and romantic drama in its focus on freelance detective Rentaro and his assistants, twin high school students Sara and Soju. 
 
Before I get to the core of the series, I suppose I should explore the major element of the series that will make or break your enjoyment and that is in the form of its multiple genre mash-ups mentioned from the prior paragraph. I suppose a comparable series you could think of this to be like would be FLCL with parodies of some anime tropes, gun-action, tangling with yakuza, and a final battle with a secret society making mutant squids (seriously), though Futakoi Alternative does not get as ridiculously over-the-top as Gainax's famous title. The comedy does lead its major characters to take on a super-deformed state at points when things get ridiculous. The manic elements of the series did have their moments where they had me snickering at the lunacy of events playing out, though it did have its moments that did not click with me. 
 
At the core of the series though, Futakoi Alternative focuses on the polyamorous love involving Rentaro, Sara, and Soju. The twins clearly have a strong amount of affection for the young man and while Rentaro does care a good deal for them, he does have his reservations for wanting to go to another level with their relationship due to a harsh past and struggling financially to support himself and the twins. Whereas many titles would try to fetishize this sort of romance, Futakoi Alternative instead chooses to seriously explore the developments of the relationship as all three are considerate of the feelings of one another and think carefully about more intimate elements of pursuing a romantic relationship, including considering intercourse. When one of the twins wind up leaving during the second half of the anime, Rentaro and the remaining twin understandably feel a hole in their lives without the other twin and come to grips with wanting her to return to their regular living routine. 
 
With these two different sides to Futakoi Alternative, it would be easy for many titles to fall apart in quality since they can't properly balance focus on manic comedy and serious drama. But the series manages to effectively balance these story elements effectively well as it knows when to get silly and when to dial back the comedy to seriously focus on the developments in the polyamorous love between Rentaro, Sara, and Soju. Still, there are some who have been turned off by this genre mash-up in the same vain as FLCL and I can see where this may not be everybody's cup of tea if they are looking for a series more geared toward a specific genre. In addition to this, the focus on a polyamorous relationship may offend some conservative viewers if they are into more traditional male-female relationship pairings. 
 
Overall, Futakoi Alternative made for a surprisingly engaging series with its effective mix of manic comedy and romantic drama focused on its main threesome of Rentaro, Sara, and Soju. The genre mash-up and focus on polyamorous love may not be everybody's cup of tea. But if you can look past both of these matters, you will find yourself enjoying this hidden 2000s gem.

Due to subsequent events, John ends up driving Sherlock to the crime scene of a murder supposedly carried out by Jack the Ripper. Even though John is only there to enlist Sherlock's help with his case, he witnesses Sherlock brilliantly uncover the truth behind the crime scene. However, he begins to realize that Sherlock is not only a genius detective but also an eccentric character.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","Taking place in modern times in and around Kabukicho in a re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes, a team of detectives are solving a string of serial murders committed by Jack the Ripper.Cases hounding Kabukicho and its residents are brokered by Mrs. Hudson through Pipe Cat, an underground bar, where the detectives meet to accept the cases that interest them.
","As someone who only remembers that Sherlock is a detective in other works about him, I really enjoyed this anime. Whether or not you are a fan of Sherlock, i think you should check this out because it may be worth your time. As an overview, this anime is interesting, humorous, and has great characters, art and the pacing and telling of episodes tend to leave me very intrigued and never really bored. It might not be for everyone who can＊t enjoy a tad of humor here and there in a detective/mystery anime, but to me everything was just right and the storytelling made each episode fun to watch.  
 
At first glance, this anime has some humor mixed in with a pretty serious plot, and I find that this was done very well. Depending on your own taste, you might or might not find the humor funny, but I surprisingly did. The humor in this show also freshens things up effectively, and I never got tired of it. The humor did not, however, get in the way of the plot, which is great since I＊ve seen many shows that get carried away and become completely intolerable. As a side note, I watched the show (so far 11 episodes) in English dub first, and then in subbed. Both are fine, but i found the humor more enjoyable when it was in English dub.  
 
The next thing you take notice of are the characters who are strikingly very likable and different. From the gay cross dressing bar waiter, to even the little kids that hang around the town, all of the characters are very likable (or dislikable) and no one is boring. The main character is fine also, as he isn＊t a wimp or boring.  
 
The main story itself seems to be dispersed among episodes that each have their own story, but when you get near the end of the single digit episodes things definitely become more understandable. There were only 2 or 3 episodes I felt were very episodic, but the rest will relate to the story. The story itself is more interesting than just catching a serial killer, and many characters are much more important than thought at a glance.  
 
I can＊t rate this a 10 or 9 because I haven＊t finished it yet since not all episodes are released, but so far I really like it. If they make the most of the remaining episodes and don＊t mess it up, it would be a close 9 or 10 to me. 

          
 
       Helpful Because of the sheer divide in loving or hating this show from many of the reviews already here, I decided this would be my first review on MAL so I could leave my own take on Kabukichou Sherlock.  This will be updated once the series ends. 
 
~ Minor spoilers ~ 
 
This show is certainly unique.  It is portrayed as an alternate version of the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes, but from watching the show, I do not think it should be taken at face value and compared heavily to the original stories.  Most of what has been shown in this has been comparative by names rather than story and character, and this show is honestly a parody/comedy mixed with mystery.  There is the obvious nod at each of the original Holmes characters, but each one has their own style or twist to the character that shines a completely different light on them.  Sherlock Holmes especially, despite being the obviously genius detective that he also is in the novels, this version portrays him as simply a part-time detective that wants to do Rakugo (i.e. kinda-sorta stand-up comedy mixed with one-man plays).  Every time his rakugo is shown, I personally get excited, although some of it isn't high-tier, it is enjoyable to watch, especially in an anime involving mystery.  Even in general we do not see much rakugo in anime, and this use is completely unique. 
 
Story - The story itself isn't exactly linear, it starts off with an episodic formula with mystery to mystery while using that formula to show off each character before a bigger plot begins to show.  I usually am not one for an episodic series, but the way it uses the formula works to fill in gaps for future episodes and ties in to the daily life of the characters. 
 
Art - For the most part, the art is a quite basic anime style, but with certain characters, there is a high level of detail present, even with certain scenes and settings.  The best parts of art, in my opinion, were during some of Sherlock's Rakugo. 
 
Sound - Although much of the music in the show is repetitious, much of it is exciting and upbeat and seems to fit quite well with each scene.  From voice acting, I really enjoy almost every character's line delivery, and each character has their own unique mannerisms and tones of voice. 
 
Character - As stated before, each of the characters which were from the original Holmes stories have their own twist in this series, but there are also a large number of original characters only unique to this series, especially considering they probably needed some Japanese characters in there somewhere.  Each set of detectives and third-party characters have pretty varying personalities, and while some do use tropes, others have interesting backstory and depth with unique personalities not often found in anime.  I personally thought many of the character's personalities were a pleasant surprise and left me with enjoyment each time they appeared on-screen. 
 
Enjoyment - Without a doubt, I am enjoying this series.  From the mysteries, to Mrs. Hudson's character, to Sherlock's rakugo, there is a lot packed into this one series that makes it hard to enjoy, even though it's not a serious and fully linear story.   
 
Overall - All in all, I believe you should watch this series if you haven't, and you should be patient with it.  Kabukichou Sherlock should be watched with an open mind without comparing it to the original Sherlock Holmes or expecting it to be a serious show, it isn't meant to be taken seriously, and it is entirely a series you should go in expecting something fun and unique, rather than serious and story-driven.  I loved it to death, almost as much as some of the front-runners of the Fall 2019 season.

          
 
       Helpful Sherlock Holmes and the novelizations and short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have always filled my life in different shapes and media adaptations. From the Sherlock who is an overly cocky, but jaw-dropping expert on criminology, criminal history and chemistry in the original novels, or the cunning expertise and meticulous memory palace using Benedikt Cumberbatch and even in more abstract forms our beloved Detective Conan. All these Sherlock incarnates connect one thing, the ability to solve every case with precision. 
 
Kabukichou Sherlock is majorly different. The story caught my interest because it dared to add the ""comedy"" genre into the mix. A mix of murder and slap-stick comedy might sound like a terrible mix of genres that cancel each other out, but bear with me. This time it will surprise you even more. 
 
Kabukichou Sherlock is a mystery show set in a district of Japan that is mostly known from the Yakuza Series in form of Kamurocho. In fact, Kabukichou is one of Tokyo's centers of crime and nightclubs which has its own allure thats hard to describe. In this story our journey into Kabukichou introduces us to a dozen of wacky and eccentric characters which are connected to the Sherlock origin story by namesake, but not so much by the original role setup. In Kabukichou crime is ubiquitous and Sherlock has to solve them together with his lesser helpful squad of acquaintances. 
 
Is Kabukichou Sherlock in any way comparable to the originals? Besides of a rearrangement of characters it isn't. The main character Sherlock, while able to solve cases really sucks as a detective. The clues are presented to him on a silver platter and he always feels smarter than the audience despite not making much an effort. He presents the solutions to the cases in old japanese style of storytelling - Rakugo. Rakugo usually involves a dialogue between two characters which perform comical or sometimes sentimental stories and act them out. In all honesty, Sherlocks Rakugo sucks really hard, but it gives him comedic relief. 
 
People familiar with the original might be put off now, because the comedic relief in Doyles novels came more from the imbeciles in the police force or Watson himself. For me this was an interesting subversion of the original story. It also made clear to me that this adaptation shouldn't be treated as seriously. 
 
And god I was so wrong: What starts off as a smirky comedy about the wacky life in Kabukichou and all the chaos that goes on there slowly takes up pace and introduces us to one? of the overarching plots. Jack the Ripper is causing harm in Kabukichou by killing women and displaying them in artsy styles. This is a stylistic device of noir stories to connect the gruesome with the arts. In another subplot they are after a specific mcguffin that is connected to the Sherlock group and wanders through the hands of different characters which then become targets. 
As Jack the ripper makes their entry into the story the pace gradually adds up until there is actually a sense of dread lingering over the characters because they have been undermined and the culprit is among them. Believe me, this show actually picks up pace and becomes brutal at times. 
 
This mystery then spiral out of control as the story throws red herring after red herring to mislead the audience. We begin going through the people close to Sherlock and investigate their behaviour and quickly we get invested into finding the culprit before the narrative tells us. In typical Sherlock Holmes fashion there I can only quote one thing: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" 
 
Characters: 
 
There are a handfull of characters worth mentioning. We have Sherlock, Watson, Fuyuto Ky?goku, James Moriarty, Mary & Lucy Morstan, Michel Belmont and Mrs. Hudson in the main group. All characters have either unique looks or personalities that coincide but not overlap with the original source materials. 
 
I advise you not to assume the traditional roles in this adaptation. Sherlock isn't always the good guy and Moriarty isn't diametrally opposite to him. Also Watson isn't always a sidekick and useless. Detach yourself from your expectations, everything can happen in Kabukichou. 
 
Sound: 
 
When we first hear the opening we might feel we took a detour to the jazzclub. This perfectly underlines the setting in Kabukichou. The lyrics of the song aren't even really deduceable without looking at the lyrics but it just somehow just wants to make you dance without knowing what is said. This is especially true for this show. You are just along for the ride but mostly don't know whats going on. It's just entertaining. The video for the opening also drags us on a wild ride through the streets of Kabukichou while showing the different characters. In a sense you could take this anime as a snapshot of life in wacky kabukichou and it works fine. 
 
Art: 
 
The artstyle isn't special and the show would've profited from being more stylized. Instead it feels like they put thought into the looks of the characters but not so much into the world. Kabukichou while being introduced as this wacky place where everything can happen looks rather bland and like every normal city street. But a lot of the action is going on in the side streets which gives it a sense of uncannyness and that there could be danger looming everywhere. The show is also pretty dark, as in not much lighting is used. The bar where all the squad gathers greatly contrasts that with bright colors and it feels like a safe haven from the happenings in the town. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
While I honestly did not enjoy the first episodes of this anime because I just didn't think Sherlock lived up to my standards both in wittyness and wits as soon the pace picks up and an actual threat is involved I was waiting for a new episode every week to find out whether my suspicions about specific characters were true or not. Safe to say this anime managed to surprise me multiple times. I wouldn't say the writing is great, but its salvageable and true to the intention of the show. 
Beyond the middlepart around ep8-11 I was hooked ultimately and so will you. But since the story is rather slow and the first cases just introduce the mannerisms of this colorful cast of characters people will drop the show before it gets good. 
 
Overall I would say if you are here for a faithful adaptation of the source material you are wrong. This show doesn't apply for that. If you are a fan of being led around by a narrative and fooled by red herrings and like to solve mysteries then you are definitely right here. Kabukichou Sherlock is a wacky show and I'd call it an acquired taste. 
 
But as soon you get used to it it turns into a wild ride with colorful characters and manifold possibilities in the chaos that is Kabukichou. 
 
Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. 7.5/10 but rather 8.

","Spiral is one of those animes that gets a lot of mixed reviews.  In my opinion, however, it is one of the greatest animes ever created for many reasons.  It\'s not completely perfect, of course -- I don\'t believe anything is perfect -- but it comes pretty darn close. 
 
---Story--- 
 
\&quot;I\'m going to pursue the mystery of the Blade Children.\&quot;  This single line, spoken by Kiyotaka Narumi, is the premise for the entire show.  Above all else, Spiral is a mystery anime, and it centers around what, exactly, the Blade Children are.  It\'s a fascinating idea, that, most unfortunately, is never fully fleshed out in the anime (I won\'t give spoilers, but the ending is definitely... not the best).  Despite its shortcomings, the plot is gripping, fascinating, and, on a level, horrifying (and no, I don\'t mean that it\'s just that bad, although some may disagree. :P).  I would suggest reading the manga -- which comes out in October 2007 -- to fill in all the holes the anime leaves. 
 
---Animation--- 
 
I was completely overwhelmed by the characters and story so, honestly, the art didn\'t really catch my attention the first time I watched Spiral.  The character designs are all very pleasing, but there\'s nothing really spectacular. 
 
---Sound--- 
 
The music of Spiral, without a doubt, always fits with the current scene.  While I thought the opening song was absolutely horrendous, the ending theme is one of my personal favorites.  The music definitely catches the mood, going from bouncy to dark and dangerous in a heartbeat. 
 
---Character--- 
 
Aaaah, here\'s where Spiral really shines through.  In all the anime I have watched, I haven\'t come across a single one that matches Spiral in terms of characters.  Every single one of them is interesting, multi-faceted, and has both strong points and weaknesses.  Spiral simutaneously holds my ultimate favorite character (Kousuke Asazuki) and my most despised character (Kanone Hilbert).  At some point or another, every character in this show goes through some developement and revelation.  Ayumu Narumi, the protagonist, is pleasantly different from most main characters you see in anime.   
 
I must also give a nod to the females of Spiral.  There are no weak damsels in need of a rescue here!  They are resourceful, brave, and just as good as any of the guys.  For those of you who are tired of wishy-washy, constantly-screaming females, Spiral is your answer. 
 
---Enjoyment--- 
 
Obviously, I enjoyed Spiral very much.  While there may be things about it I didn\'t particularly like, the sheer pleasure I recieve in watching it far outstrips those little quibbles. 
 
So, my friends, I highly encourage you to at least give Spiral a try.  If you haven\'t seen it, you really don\'t know what you\'re missing. 
 
Pros: Amazing characters, theme-fitting music, engaging storyline 
 
Cons: Less-than-satisfactory ending, somewhat corny dialogue

          
 
       Helpful Spiral is one of those series that I really, really want to love. It had the makings of a hit. But somehow, it ended with more unfulfilled potential than it started with, and I felt cheated for watching the entire 25 episodes. 
 
After a bit of exposition when we meet Narumi Otouto (as the Blade Children refer to him) and the other characters, the story poses a question to Narumi, his detective sister-in-law, and the viewers: What are the Blade Children? Almost halfway into the story, we finally learn what Blade Children are, and if you're not watching carefully you'll miss it. Probably better that you should, though, because while the series would be actually good if the secret of the Blade Children was heinous and horrendous, it's actually laughable and anticlimactic. The Blade Children seem to constantly pity themselves as ""cursed children who should not be allowed to live in this world"". As vague as that notion is, it's also a better answer for what the Blade Children are. 
 
At least half of the series is dedicated to the Blade Children trying to destroy what they believe is their one and only hope for redemption -- a storyline that is, at best, the Blade Children acting out their feelings of confusion, anxiety, and hopelessness. From my point of view, however, it was ridiculous and the writers made no attempt to use logic and reason in writing the story. 
 
Voice actors are some of my favorites, and Suzumura Kenichi did a smashing job as Narumi. Ishida Akira's treatment of Eyes Rutherford was flat and monotonic, but appropriately so for the character. Hiyono's recurrent ""weird song"", as sung by Asano Masumi, is nicely done as well. 
 
The best part of this series is the artwork. Although Spiral was made in 2002, making it 10 years old at the time of this writing, the style of art is almost the same as anime series currently airing. Other series from that period would have typically looked much different, I believe, with gigantic female eyes much larger than today's eyes. Narumi especially is attractive, with a style not found in contemporary anime. As a sign of the times, many of the male characters are wearing tons of ear jewelry and hair is even more elaborate. 
 
Overall, Spiral could have been something great, but it didn't even try to be. As a result, the whole series suffered terribly. That one decision could have made my review better by 2 stars.

          
 
       Helpful I'm a bit surprised at the mixed reviews this anime has received, I personally feel it was very entertaining and I enjoyed it greatly. When I first watched it it indeed grabbed my attention, and I must say I was addicted! Yes, there are quite a good amount of flaws but beggars can't be choosers, and nothing can be made to perfectly suit ones taste, but this one gets fairly close. I finished this anime back in 2009 so this review is VERY late. :o 
 
 
STORY: 
 
If you are intrigued by the idea of mystery and problem solving, boy you are in for a treat! Not to give anything away but the plot has to do with one main question, who exactly are the Blade Children?  It's a original idea I must say, but sadly it isn't fully understood in the anime. My only true complant is the ending of the anime, it was rushed and very unresolved, but do not let that turn you away just yet. I myself loved the plot so much I finished the entire manga, and it gets only better! Not to say the anime wasn't entertaining, it's just that most anime tend to cut a lot off from the manga. I highly recommend to watch the anime then read the manga, and you will be quite satisfied 
 
 
ART: 
 
Maybe it's because I enjoy watching older animes (huge fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, Ranma 1/2 art) But I actully liked the art style, it's something I find conforting. The only real complaint I could give would have be hair being see-through when overshadowing the eyes on this one specific character and I just found that bothersome. 
. 
 
SOUND: 
 
I found the background music was always suiting to whatever was happening at that moment, so that would be a plus. Though I really disliked the opening song, it was too annoying for my taste. -.- Though the ending song  was cute. 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
My personal favorite, they have so much dept to them it's diffcult to NOT like them! Each and every one of them have their own layers, weaknesses and strength to them. If I could I would give an 11 just because it is VERY hard these day to find a strong willed female, best of all theres a bunch of them! I have serveral favorite characters, and typically I'm a bit picky when it comes to choosing more then a few. Another plus in this anime is that all the characters do develop a bit, and that doesn't happen very often in short cut animes. You will be rooting for the main character, and I have yet to come arcoss someone like him again. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
As you may have noticed, I really loved Spiral, and though I really disliked how the ending was made, I can't help but to add this anime into my personal favorites. :) I would also like to blame the manga for making it even more loveable then it already is. 
 
To you guys debatiing out there, it never hurts to try! Really anime viewers Spiral is highly refreshing and better then your run of the mill anime! Perhaps you will find your new obsession!

","Considered to be a classic cyberpunk anime, it introduced a wave of cyberpunk and anime fans when this movie was released in 1995. However, it got overshadowed by Ghost In The Shell, which in the US became such a well-known anime movie but Armitage III had strong popularity in Japan, so that kinda counts. Armitage III Poly-Matrix is a must-see anime film for all cyberpunk and anime fans who missed this gem a long time ago. 
 
Welcome to the year 2046. The Earth became overpopulated and therefore, mankind created a colonization in Mars with the help of first type"" androids and built the city of Saint Lowell. Seventy years later, the city is inhabited by humans and ""Second-type"" androids, which are improvements over the first type and this new robots talk and react like real humans. On the space-port, a man named Ross Sylllibus arrives on Mars to meet his new partner, a young woman named Naomi Armitage, which for a partner she does know how to dress up nicely. However, all hell goes down when Armitage stops a man with a briefcase that she shot down and in the case, they find the body of a country singer named Kelly McCannon, which turns out that she's a ""third-type"" robot, able to act like a human but in a more advanced realistic way. Now humanity loses faith on the robots and now hellbent on destroying every last one of them, Armitage and Ross must now stop the man that's committing these murders and discover the secret of the ""third-type"" robots. 
 
As you probably know by now, the story is the main selling-point of this movie and why people love it so much. It asks the question of why did mankind create robots when in reality they want them dead cause robots are becoming smarter than their creators. Did we wanted to create robots for our miserable enjoyment, to treat them like slaves, to make us feel better or to have them do our dirty work for them on the city? While it doesn't go too deep, it still talks about the issues with man's relation with machine and the fear that machines will become stronger creatures than man itself, kind like The Terminator. The 2 main characters are charming and to my surprise, they are well developed. Armitage is a woman who is different from the rest of us but doesn't care about it cause she just wants man and machines to live together in the city and will do anything to protect her kind. Ross Syllibus is also a great character. He's a cop who lost trust on robots since his beloved one was murdered by a robot but in the end, he learns that not all robots are programmed to be killers and has faith that both kinds can live in harmony. The side characters are just boring, minus one character that I won't spoil here. They are useless and throughout this movie, they do nothing despite that there are riots in the city and no other cop does a damn thing about it.  
 
The animation by AIC, the animation company that worked on Oh My Goddess and Inspector Gadget, looks phenomenal for a  1995 anime film. The cyberpunk look is impressive, giving it a Blade-Runner inspiration style, and the water color art is beautifully rendered in the background. The English voice acting is good but you have to get used to them in order to appreciate it. Elizabeth Barkley starts off strong as Armitage and she gives a top-notch performance out of her character. Kiefer Sutherland starts weak as Ross cause he sounds bored at times but in the second half of the series, he does improve a bit more than the beginning of the film. The music is fantastic and it gives you chills on your spine on how well the music is composed here. 
 
Armitage III: Poly Matrix is a fantastic anime that should be watched by everyone. The story and themes are excellent, the 2 main characters are well-developed, the action is excellent, the animation is top-notch and the music is phenomenal. It's a great addition to the cyberpunk genre and I do hope that someone remake this film to a new generation of cyberpunks fans... In a good way of course.

          
 
       Helpful A product of the early 90's cyber-punk craze, Armitage the Third, like many other cyber-punk movies of the time, focused on robot/human relations and questions about what constituted as being human. 
 
The artwork is hand drawn in painstaking detail, as CGI was in it's infancy at the time, so the background artwork is very rich and complex. The main characters in the American dub were voiced by people who were A-list stars at the time, so you can expect great voice acting. 
 
One last word of warning though: Like many cyber-punk movies of the time, nudity and ultra-violence is prevalent throughout the movie. Certain naughty bits appear on screen with no warning at all.

After receiving a letter from the thief, famous actress Juri Maki seeks the help of private detective Kogorou Mouri to protect the Star Sapphire〞the ""Jewel of Destiny,"" said to represent faith, fate, and hope. Thinking he has deciphered Kid's riddle, Kogorou personally shows up to the newly constructed space theater where Juri is acting in the play ""Josephine"" in order to catch Kid in the act. 
  
The next day, Conan and the gang are invited by Juri to her holiday home, to celebrate the thwarting of Kid's plan and the success of the play. However, their triumph crumbles when a murder occurs during the flight there. Although unintentional, this sets off a series of events that escalate to catastrophic results. Conan and Kid, unlikely allies that they are, must work together to save both their friends and every other passenger aboard the plane. 
  
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']","A stage actress, Julie wants to use her star sapphire for her upcoming play and asks for Mouri Kogoro  help to protect it after showing Kogoro a letter from the Kaito Kid. On the day of the theft, Kid appears at the theatre disguised up as Shinichi Kudo but ends up fleeing in the end without the jewel. To thank them, Julie invites Kogoro and everyone to Hakodate, and they all travel on an airplane to get there. In the air, one of the show actor, Shinjo, who was supposed to be elsewhere and Ran's mother, Eri, joins them on the plane. As the plane takes off, Julie comes in physical contact with most of the individuals she invited, making them all suspects in the case of her death. The case was solved by Eri and the culprit was later found to be the makeup artist, Natsuki.
The captains were also poisoned from Julie and were not able to pilot the plane, so Shinjo agrees to take over because he supposedly ""took courses"", and appoints Conan to assist him. Conan figures out that Shinjo is Kaito Kid when Conan is asked to assist, as this logic would not apply in a similar situation. Kid tells Conan that he is no longer interested in the sapphire as he discovered that it was a fake. The storm and fire at the airport make it impossible to land while the plane fuel is running low. Conan picks a stable area that can support a commercial plane. Ran Mori and Sonoko Suzuki eventually take over piloting the plane while Kid escapes by jumping off the plane and Conan has to ""go to the bathroom."" Conan then switches over to Shinichi's voice and guides Ran for landing the plane. During the flight, Ran mentions how Shinichi is like an eclipse; one moment he's there, the other he's not. When the plane lands, Ran tells Shinichi that she loves him, but ends the moment by telling him that she suddenly sees lights at the site.
It turns out that Kid went near a police station and used police cars (because this policeman is obsessed with catching him) as guiding lights to land the plane. After the plane safely lands, the criminal is apprehended and Ran and Sonoko are treated by a medic. The medic reveals himself to be Kaito Kid, who commends Ran for landing the plane safely. He tells her they will meet again before suddenly vanishing. All went well, and the movie ends with Ran talking to Shinichi over the phone again arguing about silly things, thinking that it was Kid who guided her to land the plane, and is relieved that her secret isn't out.
","Detective Conan: Magician of the Silver Sky is a very interesting movie. The second film to feature Kaito Kid has him play a much more prominent role here than he did in The Last Wizard of the Century. But does more always mean better? Let's find out. 
 
One of the movie's most interesting aspects is how it takes three different scenarios and combines them into one, cohesive story where the elements in one part carry on into the next. While this is some very interesting story-writing, one could not help but wonder if more time went into writing one part more than the others. In 1995's Goldeneye, the movie begins with an opening so great, that the rest of the movie fails to measure up to it. The same can be said for Magician of the Silver Sky. As fun as the other two parts are, the first part is and always will be the most memorable part of the whole movie. It's kind of like eating a three-course meal, where the first dish is a juicy steak, the second is a PB&J sandwich, and the third is a bowel of chicken noodle soup. All are of varying quality, but none are better than the first dish. 
 
One other thing that people do not like about this movie is how Kaito Kid always disguises himself as Shinichi. As genius as it was for him to do so, it sort of takes out the fun of figuring out who Kid is. Back then, I wouldn't really have a problem with Kid disguising himself as Shinichi since it meant Conan can't point him out without giving himself away. But after 15 years and 2 other movies where Kaito disguises himself as Shinichi (plus 1 if you count Fist of Blue Sapphire), I think now would be a good time for Kid to change up his Modus Operandi.  
 
Despite my earlier analogy about chicken PB&J, Magcian of the Silver Sky is still a worth while watch. Everything that people love about Detective Conan is here and is still just as good. The story structure is interesting, the art and animation is pretty good, and the characters are still their usual lovable selves. Definitely a good watch.

Story-wise, it isn't the typical Detetive Conan wherein the ending is usually when the culprit is caught. It somehow has a mix of other genres as well that made it unique in a way to the other movies so far. The mystery and detective-ness of the typical Detective Conan though was outshone by the scenes in the plane. In a way that made this a bit anti-climatic in terms of mysteriousness. It was however refreshing to see a different story from the typical series. There were also some scenes that had a bit of a bland after taste to it but still the good parts outweigh those. The story was good not the best one there is but it was good. 
 
Art: 10 
Every anime has its own unique art style. What sets Detective Conan apart from the others is that aside from the unique plot the art is also different so the author's work can be easily distinguished for the others. Growing up with this anime makes my rating for it biased but I, for one, am content with the art. 
 
Sound: 8 
The usual sound effects used in the series but there were a few added sound effects to make it sound new to the ears. Not complaining with the usual opening though, it just makes it even more exciting since it is the signature opening of Detectuve Conan so nostalgia from it isn't lost to me. 
 
Character: 7 
The characters were okay though the culprit was predictable. The different sides of Kaitou Kid was seen here though his identity remains a mystery and that makes him all the more a character one can look forward to every time he appears. The kids however were a bit unnecessary in some scenes. Ran's parents however made it refreshing. Everytime those two show up it's really fun to watch. There were characters though that were a bit lacking in presence and sort of easily remained in the background. Conan though, is still the typical Conan we all know and love. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
It was not what I had expected from the title and the movie poster though, so at the beginning I thought it was going to be a full on Kaitou Kid vs Conan movie but the unexpectedness of the plot all the more made it a good movie to me. There were some scenes that for me, were not needed and felt like they were just a few added scenes to make the movie longer. But other than that it was good. Not the best Detective Conan movie I've watched but nonetheless a good movie to watch. 
 
Overall: 8 
If you want something a bit different from the typical Detective Conan, this is probably the way to go. There are a lot of mixed genres here that made it enjoyable to watch. It was a good movie. There were unexpected scenes and twists but that just made it even more fun to watch.

Now let＊s get to the actual review 
 
This anime is, first and foremost, about the atomic bomb. It＊s also about a bunch of other stuff, mostly actual psychology. By that, I mean the anime is deeply concerned with humans, their emotions and how they view the world. It doesn＊t stick philosophical jargon in the dialogue or has trippy imagery in order to insist how important it is. The situations demonstrate ideas, and psychology rears its head in character actions and thoughts. 
 
We need to talk about the bomb first. The general stort you hear in the West is that America is Big Bad mostly because it＊s powerful and has a lot of money (As much as I love Star Wars, people watch it too much). Therefore, if they dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese then the Japanese are automatically innocent. They haven＊t done a single bad thing in the war but were hapless victims of humanity＊s worst weapon. 
 
Of course, that＊s not the actual story. Read about the Rape of Nanking, about Unit 731 and the Kamikaze. Japan was one of the main reasons why that era is humanity＊s darkest hour. Thanks to the atom bomb, though, Japan could feel like a victim for a while. Victims don＊t bear responsbility. They＊re passive. Things are being done to them. The atom bomb saved Japan from the position of villain they might＊ve been placed in once Unit 731 and Rape of Nanking were exposed to the world. Sure, you can buy books about these subjects but what do you hear about more 每 the Holocaust or these incidents? Germany was the loser, but Japan was the victim. 
 
Shonen Bat and his victims mirror this. Notice how American-looking Shonen Bat is. The baseball bat is a distinctively American symbol, belonging to the country＊s most beloved sport. The manner of his dress 每 the hat, the hoodie is also more common in American than Japan. Furthermore, he has a peace sign on his hat (which was originally the anti-nuclear symbol). How he acts is by targeting people who are cornered, some innocent and some are not. By beating them up, they become victims. He releases them from that stressful position, whether it is being a bully, juggling identities or a big debt. Oh, and his name is very similar to ＆Little Boy＊. 
 
Maromi symbolizes Japan＊s obsession with cuteness. Many took it as a criticism of that. Supposedely after the war the Japanese escaped to these cute cartoons and figures. They rely on them for solace and escapsim. Its type of cuteness is called ＆yurui＊, which tends to mean bumbling and mild. Japan was turned into ＆yurui＊ after being devastated by the war. All the people who got beat up become like this. They become passive, smiling, mild and without much content. They vanish after Shonen Bat releases them from their victimhood. 
 
Maromi isn＊t a total rejection of that aesthetic. In the last episode Maromi fights Shonen Bat. Maromi represents hope. It may be false one, but it＊s some kind of hope. He came from a pet dog. Shonen Bat, on the other hand, is a weapon whose purpose is total erasure. These are two different things. 
 
Cuteness isn＊t just an escape. It＊s a total rejection of war and its stomping aggression. The problem isn＊t in cuteness itself but how it becomes a slave to the technological aggression. By that, I don＊t mean that Paranoia Agent is luddite and that it takes an anti-technological, nature-only stance. 
 
It does take a look at how a deeply technological society, how humans＊ attempts to build their own worlds cause isolation. The show opens with dozens of people rejecting others using their phone. The origins of Maromi are in the death of a dog by a car 每 a device integral for big city life. The work and school complexes put big pressure on their subjects. A failure at work doesn＊t get help in improving himself, but his superiors constantly bully him instead of letting him go. A kid who＊s used to being number one can＊t imagine being anything else. The atom bomb wouldn＊t be possible without a huge military complex. 
 
It＊s not impossible to use technology and cuteness for connection. The only people Shonen Bat rejects are a group of suicidals who meet thanks to the internet. It＊s their connection that keeps them from being cornered. The possibility of suicide sets them free, and it gives them a better escape than anything Shonen Bat does. They work for their death and find human connections through it. Everyone else is trapped in systems they can＊t exit. 
 
Maromi isn＊t free of the work system. It has appropriated him, turned him into another device. Now the people behind Maromi puts tons of pressure on Tsukiko to design another character and for the producers to get the show on time. The people behind the symbol don＊t follow its idea. Neither the consumers 每 they storm the stores, instead of relaxing with the little plushie they have. 
 
Such ideas about the nature of work and how it leads to pressure may promote laziness. The anime doesn＊t. Work is necessary, and we do see the police officer who works two jobs so he＊ll wife will be okay. Here＊s why Shonen Bat doesn＊t go after him. Like the suicidal three, the police officer has a way out. He forms connections with both his co-worker and has a wife to come home to. 
 
They say Japan has a high suicide rate and puts a lot of pressure on their students and workers. That doesn＊t sound like a culture that follows the ideas in cuteness. If the above statement is true, Japan isn＊t one big child. Rather, it＊s a man whose had so much pressure put on him that only a state of victimhood can give him escape. It＊s not just a mirror to the atom bomb, but how the Japanese culture is too harsh on its subjects and encourages them to be victims. 
 
The world in Paranoia Agent isn＊t full of privileges, with problems existing only in the characters＊ heads. It paints the modern world as claustrophobic. Social circles trap you in their gossip. Workplaces beat you when you fail but don＊t let you go. Even the glory of being the best is trapping. In a society that has few options, victimhood is a way out. That＊s very similar to war. If you can＊t win, at least be a victim. It＊s better than to lose. 
 
You＊ll hear often how weird the anime is, but that＊s beside the point. Yes, the anime isn＊t exactly linear. It blurs the lines between fantasy and reality in the last episodes. It＊s never from a conscious desire to be weird. The anime locks on its themes. By the time episodes with unrelated characters arrive, it doesn＊t feel out of place. Since the episodes are connected themetically and progress the ideas, they feel like necessary part. Paranoia Agent doesn＊t rip the traditional structure for the sake of it. It has a structure of its own because that＊s how it expands on its themes. 
 
is the sort of brilliant narrative that doesn＊t just define why anime is a worthy medium. It＊s a brilliant piece of hard that＊s worth your time regardless of what you like. It may be deeply concerned with the Japanese experience, but the atom bomb is a subject that should touch all of us. We＊re talking about the worst weapon in the history of humanity. It also connects this to the universal human experience. Don＊t let the tags of ＆experimental＊ scare you. It＊s accessible as it is brilliant.

       Helpful Paranoia Agent - 8/10 
 
I loved this show, it was a nice sip of fresh air after watching a few not-so-interesting titles. Good things about this show include an interesting visual narrative and art direction. Often it uses visual elements to narrate the story rather than using dialogue, although it also uses dialogue to narrate the story, but the important details are hidden in lots of non-important info which makes it feel like a detective movie, you pick up interesting details or not and then understand what it meant later. 
I don't think i even have to say anything about Soundtrack in this anime. It met my expectations (expectations from the composer Susumu Hirasawa, whose music i had the pleasure to listen to while watching the original Berserk TV) completely. Now i was very dissapointed by the actual plot of this show. It's very simple, albeit it has a message to it (SPOILER: Face Your Problems : END SPOILER) 
Aside from that the plot remains a mystery until it's simply dumped through info, you can guess what is going to happen from visual clues and foreshadowing if you have experience with anime, but it is still very intriguing until the end. There is also a ""weird"" factor to the plot, since it starts off in a very realistic setting, and ends in something that is rather surreal and the ending while being open to interpretation is written pretty badly in my opinion. (SPOILER: Happy end was forced, then the very last bit of the last episode hints that nothing is over, since it's the same exact scene from the first episode, but it's still in my opinion is way to forced into, it should've ended when the police officer exited the metro and found ruins of the world :END SPOILER) 
In short, the ending could've been good and reminiscent of End of Evangelion but it went that extra bit to further conclude things, yet leave them open-ended still, which makes concluding things absolutely useless. The writing and dialogue however, suffer no problems what so ever, it is entertaining and interesting, however if we are going to cherry-pick here, all the characters are way too clueless, if a killer was on the loose everybody would be a bit more serious about the situation, but this may be the very definition of ""Syouganai"", so take that as you will. 
The Suicide Trio episode is an awesome example of how narrative can make something rather simple (SPOILER: they were dead, but they ran away in their minds, thinking they are alive (wtf) : END SPOILER) because it showed things without explaining them, and only hinting at an explanation in the end. 
But enough about plot. 
Character Design is while may not be everyone's cup of tea, and the average SAO watcher will find them ugly while the average Studio Ghibli movie watcher will find them very reminiscent of movies like ""Spirited Away"", personally i found them pleasing and refreshing, it was nice to have each character was very different from each other, and that character design linked to the narrative in a way, hence all the characters looked like the typical person of their personality would, and whether you find this good or bad is entirely up to the viewer, i've found it to be both good and bad in certain situations. The quality of animation is great, but if you're getting the Blu-Ray be aware the remaster is not of very good quality, all the edges are very blurry which creates an illusion of low resolution picture, however those very same effects are generally used well to visually narrate the story and to create somewhat an atmosphere. Atmosphere, is what this show really lacks, since all the episodes are about different characters they have very different takes on the story, and consistency is not big enough of a thing here to create an atmosphere, save for maybe the 13th episode, but even that kept shifting around two different places. 
I think i covered everything there is that needs attention. 
The plot is simple and needs no analysis, if you have watched the show and missed anything just rewatch the last episode.

Review #73: 
Paranoia Agent 
 
 
In the country of Japan, there seems to be an elementary school kid that is known as Lil＊ Slugger (Shonen Bat in the Subtitled Version) and this mysterious enigma has been going around attacking people with his bent, golden bat. After Lil＊ Slugger＊s first attack, two detectives are investigating this case so they can stop this kid from making any more attacks, but they will find out soon enough... that this case is much more than they expected. To be technical, this is a Studio Madhouse production and they really are known for high production values. I＊ve said this before in previous reviews when the name Madhouse is brought up. This is to be expected most of the time. With Paranoia Agent, this series looks incredible but there are some hiccups somewhere along the way. This is also Satoshi Kon＊s only TV series and even though the budget in this show isn＊t enough to make a movie. There were some unused ideas that were never implemented in his movies and he decided to recycle these ideas and put them into Paranoia Agent, and this is quite interesting. Like his previous works, the blending of fantasy into reality really hits in this show (well for the most part). What is also used very well is the show＊s foreshadowing and it sure knew when to keep things mysterious. But regardless, the animation is done pretty well and it is even a little mind-screwy with good reasons. The music by Susumu Hirasawa is pretty damn incredible. The electronic and techno beats serve the show well and the soundtrack can be a bit eerie at times as well. And this eeriness to the soundtrack is a perfect way to compliment everything else in the show. Since this show exploits the characters＊ weakness and proneness to anxiety and fear, the way the soundtrack compliments all this is pretty impressive. Hirasawa-san struck all the chords when needed and he does not disappoint. If there is one thing about the soundtrack that is awesome, it is the opening theme ※Dream Obsessional Park§. This opening theme sounds incredible and the opening looks incredible to some extent. The closing theme does sound calming compared to the opening and it does serve as a nice contrast to the opening theme. Either way, Hirasawa-san made a fantastic soundtrack to Satoshi Kon＊s only TV series. When it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is really good. Daisuke Sakaguchi is great as Shonen Bat, Mamiko Noto is also great as Tsukiko Sagi. Also, Shozo Iizuka is terrific as Keiichi Ikari and Toshihiko Seki was also terrific as Maniwa. There are a few well-known seiyus and I guess that can be nice. As for the English Dub, it is really REALLY GOOD! Sam Regal is a very deceiving voice to hear as Lil＊ Slugger but it works. Michelle Ruff is terrific as Tsukiko Sagi and one of her best roles even though she doesn＊t play a ※normal§ character. Carrie Savage is also phenomenal as Maromi by having a cute voice for the stuffed doll as well as giving the viewer some eeriness. Michael McConnohie was also phenomenal as Keiichi Ikari and even Liam O＊Brien lands a home run in this one. Even some voice actors and voice actresses that aren＊t big names performed very well in the dub of Paranoia Agent. Not a single voice was off. Paranoia Agent has one of the best English Dubs. Period. Jonathan Klein＊s ADR Direction in Hellsing was outstanding, Paranoia Agent is probably the best dub he has directed. You can＊t go wrong with either version but I strongly suggest the dub as well before or after you watch the subtitled version. As far as characters go, this may be the hardest thing for me to talk about when it comes to Paranoia Agent. The way the show is being told is that each episode is being told in a specific character＊s point of view. For example, The first episode is told from Tsukiko Sagi＊s point of view, she does appear in later episodes but these specific episodes aren＊t mainly focused on Tsukiko. As the show progresses, we learn more of the people who are involved with the Lil＊ Slugger incidents and we even get to see their dark sides which actually make the show thought-provoking. This is a very psychological show and this does feel like a character study, but that＊s not necessarily a bad thing. It surprisingly has a plott that connects even though the episodes are mostly about the character and that character＊s point of view and that it feels non-linear in some sort of way. Is it perfect? No. There is one episode that I did find pretty pointless at times but it still wasn＊t too terrible I just wish it was told differently than what is being presented in the complete version that is before us. There is a little hiccup with the storytelling and that＊s one flaw with Paranoia Agent. When the show brings questions, it＊s thought-provoking. When it＊s eerie, it may make you feel a little uneasy. When the show reveals things, you will probably be surprised. The show does live up to its name and what I really like about this anime is that it is thought-provoking to the point that it may even make a viewer like me want to question where my weaknesses are before I reach my breaking point. I think everyone＊s had some ups and downs, but that＊s kind of why I like this anime so much. The psychological aspect is realistic, the whole Lil＊ Slugger thing is not＃ But I suggest you watch the show to get the answers because you sure are not going to get them from me. But if you must insist, I must ask you. Are you sure you want the answers you are looking for and are you willing to hear the truth when you have the answer? Sometimes, it is best that things go their own course without questions. Period. 
 
 
Paranoia Agent was available by Geneon. It is sadly out of print and this home run slugger really needs to get re-licensed one of these days. 
 
 
With all that said, Paranoia Agent is an eerie series. The show lives up to its name and it＊s psychological elements are thought-provoking. The animation is fantastic, and the music is superb. The characters are very interesting despite a few storytelling hiccups. Despite all this, this is a must-see but it may not be for everyone so be on your guard. 
 
 
I give Paranoia Agent a 9.5 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!

The group visits the Twin Towers, dubbed ※the closest thing to heaven§, on their way back home and run into Richard, Rachel, and Serena, in addition to Richard's old friend from college, Madison Monroe, her secretary Cherilyn Chrisabel, Japanese artist Kisaragi Hosui, executive Yoshiaki Hara, Twin Tower councilman Augustine Odell, Twin Towers architect Theodore Radcliff, the latter who once studied architecture under former professor-turned-serial bomber Leo Joel from the first film. Augustine, drunk, invites Madison over for the night in the tower, despite them not officially opened to the public. Madison prepared a room for him anyway. Two employees come up to the VIP elevator and talk about how a nice car pulled up. The other employee says it's a Porsche 356A, catching Conan's attention, who asks for the car's detail which matches that of Gin's. He quickly runs into the elevator looking down briefly, and sees the Porsche drive off as he approaches the entrance. Later that night, the drunk Augustine Odell is brutally murdered.
During the investigation, a broken sake cup is found and the painting Augustine had is missing. Police are drawn to two conclusions on the sake cup: it either simply fell from Odell during the murder, or it was left deliberately as a message. The Junior Detective League conducts their own investigation and interrogates Theodore, who got the job because of Odell, and Kisaragi, who was in the middle of painting Mt. Fuji despite his shades blocking his view. After their questioning, the group disbands. Vi is later seen talking with someone on the phone at Dr. Agasa's house, not realizing Black Organization members Gin and Vodka are listening on the other end.
The following day, the kids resume their investigation by interrogating Yoshiaki Hara. They arrive at his home, find the door slightly opened, and discover Mr. Hara shot to death with a knife in his hand; another broken sake cup is found near his corpse, and police conclude that a serial killer is at large. Hara's computer was erased of its data. Due to the escalating murders, Inspector Meguire pleads with Madison to postpone the Twin Towers grand opening party, but she refuses and invites them instead. Elsewhere, Vodka is searching through Akemi's empty apartment. Gin arrives attempting to track Haibara's location through a phone line, but is cut off when Conan disconnects it from Dr. Agasa's house. Haibara, still grieving over Miyano's death, runs away crying. She explains the next day that hearing her sister's voice helps calm down her. At the Twin Towers, guards have been knocked out with sleeping gas, and bombs have been put in various locations of the complex. Conan wonders if Hara was connected to the Black Organization.
At the grand opening party, Madison hosts a 30-second guessing game in which Richard wins by pure luck. She then shows off Kisaragi's art in a presentation on stage with Kisaragi, Theodore, and Cherilyn handling the production backstage. As the curtain rises, the audience is horrified to see Madison hanging above the stage with Kisaragi's painting in the background. An unbroken sake cup found below her corpse; a message left by the serial killer. A rattling noise is heard as the remaining suspects walk away. While searching for a motive, Conan solves the case thanks to a hint provided by Haibara.
Before the murderer's identity is revealed, the bombs planted by the Black Organization detonate, setting the building ablaze. Serena, Conan and Rachel evacuate in a glass elevator when it stops. Conan realizes that with her new perm, Serena looks like Shiho Miyano from behind. Conan distracts Serena, making her turn around, saving her from being shot by Gin, who thought she was Shiho.
After arriving safely to the ground, Conan re-enters the tower after learning that the Junior Detective League has not evacuated. He leaves them and confronts the serial killer, Kisaragi. He murdered Madison by taking off her pearl necklace, then placed an identical one with fishing line, attached to the top of his painting, around her neck. Kisaragi left broken sake cups behind as a symbol of Mount Fuji that had been obscured by the Twin Towers; the unbroken one at Madison's scene didn't need to be smashed, Madison's corpse already splitted the image of the mountain. Conan elaborates how Hara was murdered by Gin; the silver knife in his hand wasn't for defense, it was to identify his killer. Silver in Japanese means gin. Kisaragi left his sale cup to make it look like the work of a serial killer. As evidence, Kisaragi has Madison's original pearl necklace in his cane, hence the rattling noise as he walks. Kisaragi confesses, blaming the tower employees for the construction of the towers, an edifice that obstructed his view of Mount Fuji. Conan shoots Kisaragi with his tranquilizer dart as the painter prepares to commit suicide.
With the bridges blown off and the bottom floors in flames, Conan powers a Ford Mustang convertible with the force of an explosion to propel the kids and him to safety. Viewing the inferno from afar, Gin and Vodka confirm that Shiho Miyano was not at the towers and abandon their search for her.
","I can't help myself, but this movie isn't just one of my favourite Conan-movies, no, it is one of my favourite movies overall and, so I guess, one of those movies I've re-watched most (tied with great movies such as LotR, Titanic, the dark Knight-trilogy and so on).  
 
But why do I think so? 
There are a plethora of reasons! The animation, the storyline, the dramatic and the score... I just got into it so fast and I can't get away... 
 
Of course, the animation might be a bit outdated, because this movies goes back to the very beginning of the last decade; however, it's still wonderful to watch it! The Animation and the score, side by side, work wonderfully together! And that's why there's room for the story - it allows to improve itself even without much dialouge! 
 
I did enjoy (and I still do so) the characters and their background stories - which is for a conan movie always quite important! 
 
So, I just can say: go and watch it! 

          
 
       Helpful -Detective Conan Movie 5: Countdown to Heaven(Tengoku e no Count Down) must be my favorite movie until now of Detective Conan.  
-The reason why it  is my favorite movie is that it has scenes full of impact and action also the drama isnt missing at all. 
-Ofc as always on the Detective Conan movies we have some backstories of the characters and in this Movie we also have Vodka and Gin and i was especially happy to see Gin in a Detective Conan movie. 
-The only think that i didnt liked in the movie it was that Nemuri no Kogorou didnt play any big part on this movie.

       Helpful Many Detective Conan fans hold the first 6 movies near and dear to their hearts. Not only were these the only 6 to be released in America, but also because these movies had some of the best writing and character moments of them all. While many would point to The Phantom of Baker Street as the best of these films, I would argue that Countdown to Heaven is the best of the vintage Detective Conan movies. 
 
My first reason is that this movie is bursting to the brim with great moments from the main cast. Conan, Ran, Kogoro, the Detective Boys, & Haibara all get their moment to shine in the spotlight. The moments with these characters are so charming and fun that it's able to carry the audience through parts of the movie some would consider to be boring without. That's not to say that the story sucks. In my opinion, it's a very-well told  story with several twists and turns that keeps the audience engaged all the way to a satisfying conclusion. I think everyone can agree that everything that happens in the third part of the film has some of the best moments in the whole series(save for maybe Haibara's quick lesson about physics). If I had only one nit-pick about this film is that it is too dark. That is, a lot of scenes in the latter third are shrouded in darkness, making several scenes, including those epic ones, feel significantly less epic. If this movie received a visual update, it could easily become a strong competitor for my favorite Detective Conan movie. 
 
If you are still deciding if you should see Countdown to Heaven, then put those doubts aside and go see it! While it may not have aged well in the art style, don't let that put you off from enjoying this fun and classic movie that showcases the best that Detective Conan has to offer.

","Smash Hit definitely isn't one of the better animes I've seen. If you enjoy endless panty shots and a background plot to go with them, then this show is for you. However, if you're looking for the next great comedy to send you rolling off your chair with laughter or for an epic drama that keeps you on the edge, it'd be best for you to look elsewhere. 
 
The storyline, although it had a good idea behind it, didn't come across as intriguing. Things just seemed to trod along at a slow pace. Even when something did happen, Ikuta would simply beg her way out of the problem. The story had potential, but it wasn't implemented in an interesting, or even important way. It often seemed as if the print on the underwear each female character was wearing was more important than the production. There were parts where they tried to focus on following the dream, and doing their very best, but even then they had a skirt just waiting to be up-turned afterwards either by a stray breeze, bending over, or the neighbor kid. 
 
The artwork was decent/average. It wasn't beautiful, but it wasn't bad. A lot of the characters were a bit generic-looking, though, with nothing really memorable about them. 
 
The sound was okay. The music was bland, and sometimes seemed out of place. One or two sound effects didn't quite match up with the animation, but they were close enough that it didn't disrupt the show. 
 
Most of the characters lacked any real depth. Of course, Smash Hit is also a pretty short-running anime, so that's not too surprising. They did have quite a bit of character development behind the main character, Ikuta, though (even if all of it revolved around one thing). 
 
Personally, I didn't gain very much from watching this, and Smash Hit was pretty boring to me. Even though it's labeled as a comedy, there weren't that many jokes or humorous scenes, other than the ones involving ladies' underwear (which were repeated in every episode, usually more than once -- even running gags need to be spaced farther apart to retain the funny). While watching it, I often felt like the makers of this anime hadn't put their full efforts in to making it worth watching for anyone other than the ecchi crowd. (Seriously, this show had more ecchi shots than Otoboku.) 
 
If you like looking up girls' skirts, go ahead and watch this, but Smash Hit is certainly not a smash hit. Should you still be interested in watching it for reasons other than ecchi, then I guess you should go for it, since the series isn't long enough to make you feel like you've wasted any of your life if you don't enjoy it.

       Helpful SHIROBAKO: SMALLER, SHORTER & CUT to 10 minutes anime version. 
 
Cosprayers was a shitshow...but the inner workings and the production side of things IS more interesting than the show itself. 
 
Hit wo Nerae! is actually the last of the ""Cosprayers"" anime with Love Love? being the second and while that one looked at the casting, screenwriting and directing side of the shitshow of Cosprayers, then Hit wo Nerae! looks at the production side of things with Mitsuki Ikita voiced by Mamiko Noto (who was LA's favourite character from Love Love?), so it was in LA's favour that the anime was gonna be good right? 
 
Well much like Love Love? and Cosprayers itself, Hit wo Nerae! also fell into ALMOST the same problems as those two did but did it in a more focused effort. What's the problems Hit wo Nerae! fell into that the predecessors and successors did? Ohhh how about the same fanservicey camera up ass shots CONSISTENTLY even the point it's lampshaded onto the cameramen and the most annoying fanservice running gag of Ikita's younger brother trying to flip her skirt any chance he gets and he ALWAYS succeeds. Hit wo Nerae!'s character cast are all pretty bog standard cliche characters with like no personality, the ONLY exception being Ikita as she's both the narrative focus and has some semblance of development. So yeah typical m.o.e traits shown even in Hit wo Nerae!. 
 
Hit wo Nerae! main strength is on Ikita as Ikita is the unexpected producer of a sentai-like version of Cosprayers with all the problems that comes in with what kind of a shitshow Cosprayers was. Hell it makes sense if Hit wo Nerae! is anything to go by with the confusing plot, plot twists, tangential story changes all being likely referenced through Ikita trying to manage all the diverging plot points all while Kurume her boss is looming over her and belittling her, cameramen's *ahem* angles, her supervisor's weird requests and the biggest thing to actually impact Ikita, that of her favourite actor coming in and crashing her ideals of her dream making her change the plot to be great in everyone's eyes, only pushing everyone's ideas away in the process...yeah all that combined you can see how Cosprayers itself translated was an utter shitshow.  
 
As Ikita wanted to produce a detective film first before being forced into Cosprayers as she was a fan of a detective show in her youth but to show her worth as a newbie producer she reluctantly agrees to produce Cosprayers. But with her placed in this position she's belittled and not taken seriously by her co-workers because of her stature. Nonetheless Ikita was and IS the only character within the Cosprayers anime franchise to have some actually positive character development unlike Ooizumi from Love Love? who went in the exact opposite direction.     
 
Hit wo Nerae!'s production value is pretty much the same as Cosprayers and Love Love?, expected since m.o.e are the producers of this anime as well. But with Imagin and Studio Live helming the animation, well yeah, same typical character designs from Love Love? and Cosprayers is back as well as the pointless fanservice and yes...much like Cosprayers and Love Love?, it's uncensored but not even the titillating fanservice, with the disjointedly weird character designs, the fanservice just looks off. Though LA will say that Hit wo Nerae! seemed to dial down on the fanservice in comparison to Love Love? but that isn't saying much. 
 
Hit wo Nerae! is definitely the best of the three Cosprayers anime, with a really sympathetic character of Ikita and all the woes and constant troubles she had in being the producer of the sentai vers. of Cosprayers, toned down but still there fanservice, character development from Ikita herself and the only other draw to Hit wo Nerae! being the inside look into the troubled and outright shitshow of Cosprayers and LA can't really say it was exaggerated as what with everything Ikita went through, it just makes sense and a way for the real life Imagin and Studio Live through Ikita to actually take jabs and ""airing grievances"" at m.o.e. 
 
And if that's the case, did m.o.e just not notice this, THEY PRODUCED IT...how freakin' meta is this? Were m.o.e that desperate to release anime that they released an anime showing how bad their own company is?

However, he continue investigating, and he lost his left eye. When he was about to be killed, a mysterious group helped him and transplant an artificial eye. The eye was a super technological device that connected to the whole computer network in the world, and enabled him to control any computers. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Seinen']",none,"This two-part OVA series from 1989 is adapted from the manga by Buichi Terasawa, whose work, I must confess, I'm not terribly familiar with.  But I have seen the Space Adventure Cobra movie, and between that and what I've heard, I gather his stories typically feature two elements: manly men and shapely women.  The first episode of Goku: Midnight Eye, you'll be pleased to hear (or not), has both. 
 
Let's get this out of the way: Goku is a standard action movie, albeit one that has all the style and flair you'd expect from director Yoshiaki Kawajiri.  If you go into it expecting any more, you'll be disappointed. There are no thought provoking themes or deep characterization here.  But despite that, Goku manages to tell an entertaining story.  Which I will now spoil, for this is the only way to convey its greatness. 
 
An investigation is being conducted into the activities of a businessman the police suspect of being an arms dealer.  But one by one the officers involved in the surveillance operation are taking their own lives.  Enter Goku Furinji, a wisecracking private detective with terrible dress sense. A tie draped over his bare chest, he positively exudes manliness.  As an ex-cop who was friends with the dead men, Goku takes a personal interest in the case, despite warnings from his old boss to keep out of it. 
 
Goku is, of course, far too manly too manly to be deterred, and decides to take matters into his own hands.  After a brief encounter with a naked female android who shoots a laser from her mouth and has motorcycle handlebars mounted on her back, he faces a naked woman with a plume of hypnotic feathers and ends up with no choice but to stab his own left eye in order to save his life.  Then he drives into a river.  What a man. 
 
If you're not yet having trouble suspending your disbelief, keep reading.  
 
Duing a dream sequence, a booming voice informs a Goku that he has been given a cybernetic eye to replace the one he lost.  He wakes up, inexplicably, on a park bench and soon realizes that it wasn't a dream.  The eye is, quite frankly, shit-hot.  Not only can it access any computer in the world, it can CONTROL them.  Suddenly, Goku is practically invincible.   
 
Why was he given this eye?  Who gave it to him?  Where did the technology come from?  Pfft.  If you're the kind of viewer who gives a crap about these kind of details, you probably wouldn't be watching this show in the first place.  Suffice it to say, he wants revenge, and goes about it in the most manly way possible: by jumping from a helicopter and using his infinitely extendable staff to pole-vault through a window several thousand (possibly) floors high. 
 
I'm a huge fan of Kawajiri and his unique style is evident throughout Goku: Midnight Eye.  Like his earlier Wicked City, the show takes full advantage of his ability to create a dark, oppressive, gothic urban environment, and it's populated with a cast of elegantly designed characters.  The animation is similarly impressive, with fluid action scenes and minimal reliance on shortcuts.  The cheesy 80s synth music, however, does little but ratchet up the camp factor, which may or may not be a good thing.  I can't quite decide. 
 
So what do we have?  A stoic, indestructible hero.  Unspeakably evil bad guys. Plenty of random nudity.  Gorgeous design.  Yep, it's an 80s OVA, it's great fun,  and it's the kind of show that doesn't get made any more.  And I think that's a real shame.

          
 
       Helpful Well, after this I could say that Yoshiaki Kawajiri is confirmed as possibly my favorite director of Japanese animated movies in terms of style. What I have watched of him are not necessarily masterpieces like those of others, but I love his style. Unimportant scripts and situations, but an aesthetic that is a fucking blast with a visual mastery, way of ""shooting"" and editing that are solid gold. 
 
His films have charm and sparkle, 80s tacky elegance, always developing during nights, in hotels, pubs, discos and strip clubs. With sports cars, top cars, guns, sexy women, sex, sentimental music, neon lights, office lights, highway lights, lights everywhere, that's the charm of the night, its city lights.

       Helpful First let me give you a little backstory as to what Armitage III really is. It was one of the first cyberpunk animes to feature a strong female character (coming out the same year as the first Ghost in the Shell movie). However, it typically receives much less attention. It takes place on the planet Mars, and plays out in a ""buddy cop"" detective style. 
 Detective Ross transfers to the Mars police force trying to escape his mental anquish he feels from his former partner being killed by a cyborg. His new partner is a woman named Armitage who is secretly a ""third type"" robot masquerading as a human. The central plot focuses around a spree of murders involving these robots, detective Ross trying to come to terms with his psychological damage and mistrust of machines through Armitage, and finding out the secrets about these machines.  
Story 10/10: 
If you enjoy a bit of action or mystery you should be able to find something memorable in this story which delves into coming to terms and overcoming things that cause you pain. 
Art 10/10: 
As previously mentioned it was one of the first cyberpunk animes of this type and the setting is wonderfully gritty and future techy.  
Sound 8/10: 
While I thoroughly enjoyed the electronic/techno themed pieces I was left feeling like they could have done more with it. 
Character 9/10:  
I enjoyed the chemistry between Detective Ross and Armitage as it feels very natural like if you just met your future best friend. It also bears mentioning that there are a lot of personal issues for each character to overcome which I feel made me appreciate Armitage and Ross more, such as Armitage coming to terms with what she is meant for. 
Enjoyment 9/10: 
The futuristic setting, character models and weaponry, art of Armitage, and prevailing action/drama overtones of the anime definitely make it a fun ride.

(Source: YTV)","['Mystery', 'Shounen']",none,"Kindaichi adaptation is faithful enough to the manga, hence making it good. However, in some cases they left out few of the key clues for the mystery, so it makes it harder for the audience to actually participate in the Kindaichi experience (ie: the Sherlock experience). 
 
In comparison to the manga, Kindaichi anime is slightly behind in the details as from a manga fan's perspective, the anime played well in building up the tension and the suspense, but lags behind when it comes to hinting the killer. 
 
Overall though, the show is a good introduction to the Kindaichi experience as in plenty of the cases, especially when you rewatch, you can actually catch up the author's hints for how the crime was committed. 
 
The Kindaichi franchise still goes strong despite its age and this series is a good example of why the franchise has a strong backing of loyal fans. Kindaichi Returns is also an adaptation of many loose cases in comparison to the original run, hence it's easy for viewers to just hop in and follow what is going on. I'd say if you do not have a way to follow the original run, Kindaichi Returns is a good way to introduce you to the franchise and understand why the fans are loyal to this series.

          
 
       Helpful I have been a fan of the Kindaichi Series for over four years. The stories are fun, exciting and easy to follow. I am an avid watcher of crime related shows and movies, so when the main character Kindaichi reveals how the criminal committed the crime, I am surprised when my conclusion is different. I love the ""manzai"" comedy act between Miyuki and Kindaichi. Miyuki is of course Kindaichi's partner, love interest, and best friend. I would like to see a progression between the two and so would Miyuki. If you are looking for a new anime to watch and want to start with this series, please start with the first released Kindaichi series. There are characters and plots that run throughout the series and you will not understand some episodes without prior knowledge. I hope you come to enjoy the Kindaichi Series as much as I have and I look forward to a new ""File"" of cases to come.

Also I need to add that everything was perfectly clear in this series so you don＊t necessarily need to watch prequel to understand the plot.  
 
This is a typical detective-mystery anime that revolve around high school student Hajime Kindaichi, grandson of famous detective. Anime focuses on Hajime＊s efforts to solve the mysterious circumstances of different crimes by means of clues, investigation, and clever deduction. And the most important thing you can＊t really guess who the perpetrator is, so you＊re into it till the end! What makes it even more interesting, even if you know who the murderer is, you have no clue why he did it or how. In the moment all of this is reviled there is also that element of surprise which makes it so exciting to watch. Usually the stories are quite sad so there we have a quick peek into human souls and various motives for murder are reviled. Although there are a lot of serious and emotional moments you can enjoy a lot of funny moments and light comedy too. Perhaps it is not as realistic and advanced as some other animes but it＊s fun to watch. One more great thing about this anime are the characters. Hajime is loveable, determined, intelligent, just great main shounen character. With help of his lovely friend Miyuki, he can solve every crime. 
 
Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns is really enjoyable anime with lots of qualities so if you like this shounen-detective genre with mysterious plot and exciting stories I truly recommend this one.

In terms of comparing it against the main season, it is actually a very good OVA. The show leaves questions unanswered but not in a way that you need to find out.  
 
It is a fun and exciting one with some great scenes that are well thought out.  
In terms of the story, it flows really nicely and gets development.  
 
You actually get a nice side of Kinji that is tolerable for this episode which again is nice to see for a change. You see more of the girls being girls and Aria who is just too cute.  
 
As an OVA it does a really great job. If the main season had followed a style like this it would have been so much better.  


          
 
       Helpful I am writing this because I simply do not believe the other reviews give you any idea of what to expect and are just fans of the show, but lets take a subjective look shall we? 
 
It's bad. I won't say ""Holy moly drop this and don't even look back"" but it's really pushing what's okay, even for this show. It's an OVA so don't expect development and EXPECT some fan-service with it having an ecchi tag an all, but I am not holding back for this. It is random, you don't get any real idea of what's going on besides the first several minutes which are fine and what I'd expect, then it drops. Hard. 
 
*From here on, light spoilers* 
 
There is no conclusion, hell it even seems to be a groundhog day thing maybe but guess what? You don't get to find that out. Does anybody properly question what or why at any point EVEN THOUGH they're descendants of detectives and thieves among other things? Nope. It's dumb. Looking at it from the outside you would quickly see that. 
 
Watch this if you're planning on going onto the 2nd season, that's cool, I've done it this way and don't regret it, I just wish it wasn't so...meh. 
 
A solid 4 for overall score and that's it. I just want people to know what they're in for and even as a first review I think this gets it done.

          
 
       Helpful I dislike Hidan no Aria, not to a large extent, but it was certainly not a crowning achievement. 
That was the TV-Series. 
This however - This is gold. 
 
Story: 9 
Okay admittedly, I only gave this a 9 because of the nature of the story in the series, but that's the context this will be watched in anyway. Considering how mediocre and bland the rest of the franchise at this point is, this OVA is just incredibly surprising. 
This starts as an ordinary onsen-episode. The main cast goes off to bathe in a hot spring: Fun will be had, skin will be shown, noses will bleeding. At least that's what you'd expect, and that is the way it goes for the first few minutes. 
However, throughout the first half of the OVA a few small moments are thrown in that just don't fit right. From the camera lingering strangely on empty scenery to pretty blatant foreshadowing as to the nature of what is coming next, we get plenty of hints that this will veer off into strange territory. 
Something is wrong with that onsen and guns won't help... 
 
Art: 7 
While the art is mostly consistent with what you'd expect of a moe show, the moments that are otherwise foreign to this franchise play quite cleverly with the regular aesthetic of the show. None of this is outstanding, but it serves its purpose well. 
 
Sound: 10 
The sound is ultimately what sets the right mood for this OVA. While the performances are what you'd expect, it's really the score and the more subtle collage of ambient sounds for the darker scenes that make this such a surprising divergence from the rest of this franchise. 
 
Character: 2 
Look at us! We are all descendants of historical figures and we portray their heritage inaccurately. It's so quirky! 
There is really not much else to this despite the moe overtones. 
Although the girl with the wolf is quite cute... 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
It gets better by the minute. There is a small cop-out at the end, but it's forgivable. After all, they couldn't pull a complete 180. 
 
Overall: 9 
If you watched the show and enjoyed it, you will find this to be interesting, but not particularly special. 
If you did not watch the show, you might still enjoy this, regardless of whether moe is your thing or not. After all, moe is not really the focus of this OVA. 
 
And if you watched the first TV-series and did not like it: 
WATCH THIS! You've earned it. 
 
Edit: I edited this review years later because my English has improved over the years and I was quite ashamed of this review once I rediscovered it.

These supernatural occurances are beyond comprehension and bring fear and terror to the people. Only one person is not intimidated by the evil underlying these occurances and is willing to challenge them: Hyuga Mayuki, a young boy detective who holds a special insight power that allows him to uncover the real truth behind these occurances.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","Thirty years prior to the events of the series, the city of Tokyo was destroyed in a massive earthquake. From the ruins of the former megalopolis, Kyuto was established. In this new city, supernatural occurrences are progressively increasing and the only one capable of unraveling them is Hyuuga Mayuki, a boy detective and esper.
","How often do you see series listed on MyAnimeList have close to no reviews? The society of anime lovers barely ever leaves a show unattended and this particular oddity tickled my fancy. 
 
I've started watching Suteki Tantei Labyrinth out of curiosity. The trailer and art suggested it must have been a great show of its time and now it was my job to reveal the mystery behind the absence of reviews. After all, it also meant a great opportunity to be noticed〞if I wrote one, it wouldn't be lost in the sea of others. Was I any intrigued for the plot? Barely. 
 
As the series begun, the first thing I've noticed was art. In my opinion, 2007 was generally the year of visually appealing series and the point when animation and digital art had completely taken over the industry and introduced the audience to the style most of the mainstream animes rely on today. Although a lover of old school, I'm a huge fan of the stereotypical millennium anime art style. Suteki Tantei Labyrinth, aired in the fall of 2007, had also adopted the back then novelty style, which made the series particularly pleasant to my eye. It was especially delightful after Gakkou no Kaidan I've reviewed a while ago. 
 
The beginning gave anime a positive vibe of secrecy and a mystery filled story ahead, although I was a little disappointed to see no opening at the first episode. I'm that oddball who genuinely listens to the opening and ending songs, and often judges series by the soundtrack. As stupid as it sounds. Truth be told, the beginning made me tense with paranoia: will everything go wrong in the beginning or will the creators mess up by the end? 
 
It did not take long 'til I found myself genuinely enjoying the show. Surprisingly, two episodes into the anime I found myself fully captivated and even gasping as events unfolded. As a person who's seen a handful of series, I must admit it's rare to have me on the edge and truly interested at the very beginning. 
 
What had truly impressed me were the plot twists and unexpected turns. On multiple occasions I would roll my eyes thinking I've already solved the mystery before the characters did, meaning the next two episodes were to drag, and every single time I'd be proven wrong. It was a pleasant surprise and something you'd expect from a detective anime. 
 
Another highlight should be placed on the characters. Suteki Tantei Labyrinth has loads of them and yet we never know who (apart from Mayuki) are actually the main cast or who are side characters. In fact, it changed so much through the series it is simply impossible to tell now. My biggest compliments are dedicated to the villain, though. 
 
A common thing to see in anime shows is that the villain is a bad guy no one wants to deal with as he seeks to destroy everything and everyone on his way. And so this leads to the fact the ""good"" characters only interact with the ""baddie"" when it's a fight time. In Suteki Tantei Labyrinth, however, the villain is actually pretty chill to talk even to representatives of the enemy. I was very pleased to see the antagonist being presented as a human being, capable to hold a civilized conversation instead of just yelling and destroying everything in his sight. 
 
However, once the villain eventually stepped into the game, the anime went downhill. Although creators clearly tried to make it a transition in a new arc, even changing the ending song, I seriously wish they simply carried on with the primary mood of the series. 
 
Now, where do I even begin with the cons? Probably the unnecessary episodes AKA fillers. Although Suteki Tantei Labyrinth is only 25 episodes long, holy molly, it's full of fillers. While I could understand the first episodes not contributing much towards the main story and are just there to hook the audience in, throwing absolutely unrelated episodes midway the series is just wrong, especially when the anime is so short. 
 
Next step would be the characters. Although it's understandable the new arc will require new characters appearing, there was absolutely no need to throw so many of them in, especially with no intention of developing them anyhow. It felt as if the author just didn't know how to cope with another half of anime he produced〞either it was too much for him, or not enough room he tried to squeeze everything in. In the end, the result stays the same: it sucked and lost its primary vibe. Worst of all, it became predictable. 
 
Previously logical and consistent anime in the blink of an eye turned into an incoherent chaos with a bunch of new characters, new powers, new concepts, new backstories. Although I've somewhat enjoyed learning more about Seiran, whose story was probably the best of the lot, it was still pretty bad. The beautiful series that kept me tense and curious were long gone and replaced by what seemed like a sloppy fan continuation. It had so very little to do with the first episodes it was awful. 
 
In the end, nothing really made sense and so many plot holes were left it made me sad. 
 
When I've first started the series I did not think I would like it. I did not expect to dislike it either. All I wanted was to review it and to find out why others haven't done so. I can't tell if I came across the reasons, but I've come up with an assumption. 
 
The series started great and from episode 2 I was mentally planning how I will praise this unnoticed masterpiece and recommended it to my boyfriend at once. However, midway the series it changed so drastically the previous joy of mine had vanished, leaving me nothing but a bitter taste of ash. 
 
Such unexpected let down hit me harder than I thought and in fact, I felt like giving up on the review altogether. It was just painful how an anime with such great potential was ruined by what seemed to be a careless flick of a wrist. 
 
Truth be told, I myself postponed this review for two weeks, now nearing the end of another series I watch, but eventually decided to share my insights. 
 
In conclusion, I'm sure the anime was noticed and seen by many. The lack of feedback is likely caused by feeling cheated and general confusion of how a 10 went down to a weak 5. It is difficult to rate an anime half of which was brilliant, but the other half a disaster. 
 
Did I enjoy it? Yes. 
 
Am I disappointed? Also a yes.

          
 
       Helpful I really like this anime because for me its something knew. It is unlike an other detective anime which on revolves around crimes and such. The characters have different kinds of past and it was very interesting. 
 
When we talk about the supernatural the first thing that will come into our minds will be ghosts and monsters. This anime has defined supernatural on another level which is a bit interesting. Well if you like something new watch this anime

The museum that houses the cutlass and pistol of the daring pirate duo does wonders for the small island's tourism.  
 
On a trip to the island, the famous Kogorou Mouri is joined by his daughter Ran, her best friend Sonoko Suzuki, the Detective Boys, and Conan Edogawa. Following a mix up at the hotel regarding their rooms, the group encounters treasure hunters and becomes acquainted with the island's treasure fever. Sent on a hunt of their very own, the Detective Boys scour the isle; while in far harsher waters, Conan discovers a murder. The police, following a clue from a recent robbery, arrive soon after, and Koumi is plunged into chaos.  
 
What follows is a mad dash by not only the treasure hunters but also the inhabitants of Koumi to secure Anne and Mary's long lost booty. All the while, however, Conan, Kogorou, and the police search for the one thing far greater than riches〞justice. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Shounen']","Takagi and Sato chase thieves that robbed a supermarket. The thieves are injured in a car accident. One faints, the other is questioned. He mentions Koumijima (also Koumi Island), and Jolly Roger.
The scene changes to show Mouri Kogoro talking to the hotel receptionist on Koumijima. Behind him are the Detective Boys, Doctor Agasa, Ran and Sonoko. Kogoro brags how he won 300,000 yen by finishing a crossword puzzle, which Conan actually solved. The receptionist tells them their reservation was not found. At that moment the department head of the Tourism Agency, Iwanaga Jouji, appears and confirms their reservation but saying it is not at the hotel.
Afterwards, three muscular men walk past them and Conan proclaims they're treasure hunters. Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Genta are excited there is a hidden treasure on the island. They are driven to an inn owned by Mima Kasuo. Iwanaga helps them plan their activities. The Detective Boys are going on a treasure hunt, Ran and Sonoko are going diving, and Kogoro is going drinking.
Ran and Sonoko go to the diving shop owned by Mabuchi Chika to rent diving equipment. Yamakuchi Kimiko the diving instructor will come with them on their dive. Meanwhile, the Detective Boys are taught about the legend of the pirate duo, Anne Bonney and Mary Read and the treasure they buried on this island. Iwanaga then gives the Detective Boys treasure maps with five spots for stamps. The stamps are two numbers, either red or blue. They must find the locations via clues in treasure boxes beside the table for stamps. They get their first stamp in the museum.  Their first clue is ""Even if the setting sun is almost at its end, a pirate still shines."". Iwanaga lets them rent bicycles and they start the search.
Back to Ran, Sonoko, and Kimiko, they are diving when they see a shark. They hide in the corner and find sharks surrounding the three treasure hunters, one soaked in blood and bleeding badly. The two men defend the wounded person, one by using his oxygen mask to blow oxygen at the sharks, and one by using his swimming motor to push them away. The three ladies bring the boat and the men climb onto the boat with their injured friend.
Back with the Detective Boys, they found the second stamp in a cave with bio-luminescent plankton. The second clue is ""The thin pirate would laugh."". Ai tells Conan that she saw the boat that Ran used for diving and that someone was bleeding. Conan worried  about it so he follows the boat to the infirmary.
At the infirmary Conan finds Ran is safe. The two men are praying for their partners recovery, but he is pronounced dead. Conan, finding it suspicious that professional treasure hunts were attacked by sharks examines the dead partner's clothing. In his diving suit was a plastic bag with fish blood. He explains the deeper you go in water, the higher the pressure increases and that the bag exploded attracting the sharks. Just then Mouri Kogoro comes through the window drunk. Ai sets up the evidence so it can be noticed by Kogoro. Kogoro proclaims to the people in the infirmary a murder has taken place.
Conan goes to the diving shop to investigate since the diving suits are stored there. He learns that the shop does not fear thieves so it is never locked, making anyone the culprit. Back at the lodging, Conan discusses this with Doctor Agasa. The Detective Boys call Conan asking him for help and telling him they are at the hanging bridge. Ai decides to stay behind.
Ayumi and Mitsuhiko cross the bridge while Genta follows slowly behind. A sign tells them that anyone that weighs more than 40 kg can not cross the bridge. Ayumi and Mitsuhiko figure out the clue, ""The thin pirate would laugh, while the fat one would cry."". Ayumi and Mitsuhiko find the third stamp, and find the second clue, ""Pirates don't cry."". Conan comes and proclaims that sign is just a hint and is not the actual bridge limit and crosses. They all return to the lodge for dinner.
Back at the hotel, Inspector Megure, Takagi, and Sato arrive by helicopter to interrogate the two treasure hunters. The treasure hunters names are revealed to be Izu Yamamtaro and Matsumoto Mitsushi. After refusal to cooperate, Takagi tricks one of the members into giving his fingerprints by giving them a match for their cigarettes.
After dinner, Mima tells the Detective Boys what the crying pirates are. They go to the beach where when wet sand is stepped on, it makes the sound of a sob. They walk to the part where the sand does not sob and find an old broken boat. Inside the boat, is the fourth stamp and the third clue ""Pirate's souls will go to heaven."". Conan notices that the treasure hunters are paying Mabuchi for something and finds it suspicious. He investigates and follows the treasure hunters.
A little time before Conan's discovery, at the place where the officers came by plane are, the alarm goes off to show that a disturbance in the museum was detected. They find out that Anne's gun and Mary's cutlass was stolen. Back with Conan, the treasure hunter are entering the car when they are shot far away by an unknown stranger. Conan examines where the shot was placed and finds tire tracks. He takes a picture of it.
The next day, Conan compares the tire tracks to the bikes. He discovers GPS trackers a small number of bikes. After eating breakfast, the Detective Boys continue the treasure hunt, while Conan continues his investigation. While wandering, he overhears the investigation team, and hears that a storm is coming. He learns that the rifle that fired the bullets must be quite old and that Mima was the only one to own a rifle that old.
Back to the Detective Boys, they find the final stamp and the last clue, ""The numbers are the hints"". The Detective Boys figure they should ask Mima. Conan asks Mima on where the treasure is since he is a treasure hunter. Ran and Sonoko visit Kimiko and they talk. The officer comes and ask for Mabuchi to come to the investigation room. Ran, Sonoko, and Kimiko leave the store only to be taken hostage by the treasure hunters.
Mima takes the kids and show them the original map made by Anne 300 years ago. It is exactly like the map Iwanaga gave the kids. They figure out the red and blue color on the numbers are for the first or surname. The numbers are actually letters from the English Alphabet. It spells out Jolly Roger, the flag of a pirate. The skull on the pirate flag on the 300-year-old map reveals the letters DOS DIOSAS, which in Spanish means Two Goddesses. It means the entrance to where the treasure is between two goddesses.
Back to the treasure hunters, Kimiko is knocked out. The treasure hunters take Ran and Sonoko on a boat toward Yorioyajima (Skull Island). Kimiko arrives to the inn and tell them they are being taken to Yorioyajima. Conan tells the Detective Boys to inform the officers and tells Mima to take him to the island. The professor gives two mini oxygen tanks that supply 10 minutes of oxygen to Conan.
Back to the treasure hunter, they are preparing to dive. They cut Sonoko to use her as bait and tell them to dive or else. They dive and enter the cave. Conan uses the original entrance and enters the cave above ground. The treasure hunter find the treasure room, to only find a boat with nothing precious on it. They are knocked out by Conan and his soccer ball. Conan tells Iwanagawa to come out of hiding and knew that Conan was being followed. Conan revealed that Iwanagawa set up the puzzle and got them to come to Koumijima, copied the treasure map, and shot the treasure hunters so he could get the treasure himself. After realizing there is no treasure, Iwanagawa gives up.
Suddenly, an earthquake strikes and water starts to fill up the cave. The cave also releases methane clathrate. Conan tells everyone to go into the cabin while he kicks a chain into the ceiling to start a spark that will cause an explosion to blow open the ceiling. Conan gives Ran and Sonoko his oxygen masks and tells them to set the oxygen tanks on the criminals too. Ran asks him if he will be okay and Conan lies that he has a mask. Conan starts the explosion and jumps into the cabin just in time. The boat floods with water and Conan is saved by Ran sharing her mask.
The boat bursts out onto the ocean and finds the investigation crew's ship instantly. The boat they are on start to break and they jump into the ocean and climb onto the investigation boat. Mima says that the treasure was the boat and reveals more about Anne and Mary. Mary was caught and placed in prison so Anne set up the boat for one day when Mary would escape and they would sail the seas. He says that Mary died due to an illness in prison and that Anne waited till she died of old age.
At the post credit, Conan asks how Ran knew he did not have a mask. She tells him that like Shinichi, they give the same face when they are lying and has a flashback to when Shinichi gives her an umbrella while he walks home in the rain.
","Yo ho, yo ho, a detectives life for me! ...uh...anyways.  
 
The Detective Conan movies are a yearly tradition that can either be an amazingly fun ride or just a slightly longer episode of the show, depending on the strength of the story itself. Jolly Rodger in the Deep Azure? ...kind of in the middle, I'd say.  
 
Story (6/10): As per usual for a Conan movie, it starts out with the whole gang (Conan, Ran, the Detective Boys, Hakase, Sonoko, and Kogorou) going somewhere, in this case an island that has the claim to fame of having the cutlass and pistol of famous female pirates Anne Bonnie and Mary Read, and supposedly a treasure left behind by them is somewhere on the island. This means our heroes end up entangled in a treasure hunt, treasure hunters, and the usual wacky antics before the mystery reveals itself: where is the hidden treasure and what is it? 
 
Honestly the story here is pretty weak and you'll figure out the mystery itself pretty quickly (ironically an English speaking audience can figure it out most of the clues faster than the main cast). The 'twist' on the treasure is also pretty easy to see coming. (I'd even go so far as to say that watching One Piece or the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie will have clued you in as to what it is.) Most of the characters introduced are either OK to annoying, and the villains are weak, especially for a Conan movie, where the villains are meant to be interesting. I won't say that the story itself is bad (there are some cool moments), but it's a fairly middle of the road movie for the series.  
 
Art (6/10): While the art is really no different from the show, the movies still do bump up the animation enough for the action scenes. The background of the island is pretty bland though. When I heard the title, I was thinking more ocean scenes and underwater stuff (though to the movies credit, there are some pretty neat diving scenes), not 'tourist island'. Otherwise it all looks OK. 
 
Sound (6/10): I almost wish they added POTC style background music, cause otherwise this was pretty average. The normal Conan anime tracks play and while they still are awesome, I honestly kind of wanted more swashbuckling style music for a story centered around pirates and a treasure hunt. (Call me a cheesy chick but come on!)  
 
Character (6/10): As I mentioned above, we have the normal Conan characters showing up and it's pretty standard that there isn't anything stand out to mention about them, so for the sake of the review I'll ignore the normal cast and talk about our movie cast, save for 2 at the end. 
 
The movie cast is honestly really damn boring. There's the 2 treasure hunters who are assholes (guess who the villains are?), a plain tourist department head who barely shows up, the 2 diving instructor girls are basically drive by characters for how fast they become unimportant, and the one interesting character is the inn owner that the group stays with. If you've seen the show (or even the other movies), these characters are pretty bland and not that fun to watch. While nothing is really wrong with them, they just feel like they only need to be in the story for about 5 minutes, not the entire film.  
 
But at least Ran and Sonoko get to be cool in this film! Yup, for once our 2 high school girls get a little development and get to show off their friendship for the viewers, so at least that was a treat.  
 
Enjoyment (6/10): Yeah...this wasn't a bad watch, but I've had more fun watching other Conan movies. This one just seemed to drag and by the end I was looking at the time-stamp to see how much left I had. I did have fun with the last 20 minutes of the movie, but that's out of an hour and 41 minutes. :/ 
 
Overall Detective Conan: Jolly Rodger in the Deep Azure is a pretty average movie and nowhere near the best that the Conan movie series has to offer. The story itself is pretty bland, lacking the normal coolness or sense of intrigue that others have, with a just there set of movie characters, and a fairly weak story resolution. If you're a fan of the series, give this a watch when you have time, but I would say check out the other movies. 
 
6/10 = a fairly average Conan movie with an OK plot, but nothing spectacular to warrant any rewatch value; while not fully recommended, it isn't a bad movie if you have time to kill, though Conan fans will probably be bored quickly

story line was really very great!! not to mention pirates named anne and mary actually existed!!! u'll enjoy the entire treasure hunt game!! 
 
art work was also quite nice!! ran was looking damn cute!! and somehow i also started liking sonoko!! detective boys, brave as always and mouri, dumb as always!!! and conan adoring as always... 
 
sound was the best part in the movie making thing!! you'll get goosebumps as you here the sharks attack or the cave fall.. many more instances when ur heartbeat will rise due to the sound effect!! 
 
the overall enjoyment and value for time was there! can say one of my fav dc movie at present don't worry ull enjoy the stuff trust me :) 


          
 
       Helpful Of all the Detective Conan movies out there, it is commonly agreed upon that Jolly Roger in the Deep Azure is the weakest film in the entire catalog. No big action scenes, no international stakes, and an overwhelming lack of fan-favorite characters. It's just Conan and the gang solving pirate-themed riddles at a small tourist island with the possibility of finding some lost treasure. While I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who want more action and fan-favorite characters in their movies, I will say that Detective Conan: Jolly Roger in the Deep Azure is still a fun and silly little adventure film that's still worth being remembered. 
 
One of the things that I like about this movie is how it incorporates the pirate-themed elements in its mystery. Beginning as an innocent game of scavenger hunt only to turn into something much bigger is pretty well done. The way the movie parallels Ran and Sonoko with the pirates Anne and Mary is extremely silly, but fitting. The way Conan is given so much authority in the later parts of the movie is absolutely bonkers (it just works, okay?). In the end, I'm still confused about how much the culprit knew about the treasure in the first place. That said, one aspect that I find to be really worth mentioning is that not once does Ran whine for Shinichi to come and save her. Given who she is and how often she does it, it almost feels like something is wrong with her (crazy, right?). Music and animation are nothing to write home about; if you watch the anime, then you know what you're in for. 
 
In the end, this isn't the kind of movie you watch for the thrills or fan service. This is the kind of movie that you watch on a lazy afternoon. Given this movie's reputation, I don't expect everyone to agree with me. The only consolation I need is the knowledge that I reviewed this film and judged it all on my own.

Up front, I'm going to say that the sex scenes are too few and far between, and are far too short, with most of the running time being taken up by the plot. I could see someone maybe getting their rocks off the one of the situations in this hentai, but the whole thing is filled with budget 90's hentai animation, so I don't know how many people are going to get their jollies off to this one. 
 
And I'm pretty sure some of these sex scenes have been done better in some other schlocky 90's softcore porn. So I wouldn't recommend it for the porn. So if you don't mind me, I'm going to be regretfully spending the rest of the review pulling apart the plot of a cheesy hentai that doesn't need this level of criticism. 
 
Right off the bat, if I were the main character, the one thing that I wouldn't be doing if I was the main character is going around to different people claiming that I'm a detective. Already, people aren't going to trust one another because of the murder, and I'm pretty sure people aren't going to trust me just because I claim that I'm a detective. Plus I haven't seen our main character do any even remotely like detective work outside trying to solve a case that he's one of the suspects in. 
 
Unsurprisingly, this has all of the cliches. Premonition of future events in dreams, running into the character without knowing their the bad guy despite the fact that it was very obviously telegraphed to the audience, one of the characters creepily talking about the Necronomicon, making him look like a really obvious bad guy, or red herring. Gotta fill out the plot in your porno somehow, even if that's not what we came here for. 
 
The hentai even brings up the main characters names, places, and dates and times as text on the screen as they appear. You have time for the most tired cliches in the book, but not enough time to introduce your characters properly. I know that porn is supposed to have low standards when it comes to the plot, but you don't include this much plot unless you want to actually write something meant to entertain people. If Stephen King can write cheesy plots and dialogue and still be considered a good writer, then you need to keep up. 
 
Most people don't have a fetish that requires filling in ~75-80 minutes of your 90 minute porn with backstory and character motivations. Fucking is and should be the backstory and character motivation for a porn, and that's worked fantastically for decades. Although the fact that that the main character just stumbles into somehow fucking women, and even HE is surprised by the fact that he's getting laid out of nowhere, which is kind of humorous. 
 
Plus this has some violence and gore, like one of the main characters coming across a dead body with the skin on their face ripped off. I guess if you've ever been annoyed that your horror movies had their sex scenes cut down to barely anything by the ratings board of your country, maybe I could see someone liking this, but that's an incredibly niche group of people. 
 
Somehow this anime falls into the trope of ""Well, they're not actually related, so it's technically not incest"", because characters keep bringing up the fact that our main character and the girl he adopted are more like a couple than blood relations. I guess hentai can't help but shove in SOME sort of hentai trope. 
 
The main character is voiced by the sexy voice of Dan Green, who is probably most famous for playing Yami from Yu-Gi-Oh. Looking at his list of roles, he seemed to act in a few different hentai, Mystery of the Necronomicon being one of it. I'm guessing that this isn't one of the roles that he talks about, but I still appreciate hearing his voice, even if it is in an embarresment of an anime. He's also the only one in this whole thing giving a good performance. I don't blame him from taking a role for a paycheck though. The rest of it borders on so-bad-it's-good, but none of it's really all that memorable. 
 
The plot is pretty much that of a schlocky made-for-cable film that would have been made in the 90s to sell cable subscriptions just so you'd hope you could see maybe see one maybe half decent sex scene out of the dozens on ""movies"" on their service. It even has the cheesy saxophone playing over sex scenes. And one song that sounds like it came out of a NES game .Although, for some reason it plays over the climactic scene near the end of the anime, which is hilariously out of place. 
 
So if cheesy so-bad-its-good horror/thriller with a strong Stephen King vibe (the main character even mentions Maine like Stephen King does in every single one of his novels) with a few sex scenes thrown in sounds like fun to you, then this might be worth checking out.

          
 
       Helpful With the amount of hentai out there that are filled with tentacles galore, it was only time before hentai adapted one of H.P. Lovecraft's tentacle filled stories, which leads us to Mystery of the Necronomicon. 
 
The anime follows private detective Satoshi Suzuhara and his adoptive daughter, Asuka Kashiwagi, as they spend time at an isolated ski resort. But when a snowstorm cuts off all links to the outside, a string of gruesome murders occurs, and Satoshi becomes the main suspect. It becomes a race against time as Satoshi must find out who is behind the murders.

Wheeler is brought back to life by Jody Summer and Dr. Stewart, who work with a group of good racers who try to keep prize money out of the hands of unsavory people like the Dark Million Organization run by Black Shadow and Deathborn.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Cars', 'Sports', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","While there were originally four F-Zero pilots in the first game, this has grown with each title to over forty characters in the later games of the series. Each character has their own unique vehicle, story and reason for entering the F-Zero Grand Prix, but the most well known character is Captain Falcon. The winner of the Grand Prix receives a huge sum of prize money, but many pilots have been lost pursuing it.The F-Zero games are derived from the 20th and 21st century Formula One races and the fictitious F-Max Grand Prix races from the 24th century. The games portray races in the future as having come under the influence of wealthy ex-space merchants. They thought that a fast and violent race would be an effective way to get people to gamble, so the ex-merchants established the F-Zero Execution Project. The F-Zero Grand Prix dates to the 26th century, and is still sponsored by the wealthy elite who originally organized the Execution Project for those events. These races feature the most technologically advanced racing machines, competing in numerous circuits of fast-paced action. It is known for its wild fans, and usually eccentric competitors. Winners of the Grand Prix receive large sums of money, as well as a great deal of prestige throughout the universe.The F-Zero games are primarily set on a futuristic Earth in the 26th century, although some games take place much earlier and some circuits have been set on different planets. F-Zero X defined the F-Max Grand Prix as the precursor to the F-Zero races which took place during the 24th century. According to the American version of F-Zero GX, the greatest driver in the F-Max Grand Prix was Sterling LaVaughn; a statement that would lead to inconsistencies in the sequence of events of F-Zero's storyline.
F-Zero begins in the year 2560 where the human race's countless encounters with alien life forms throughout the universe greatly expanded Earth's social framework resulting in trade, technology transfer, and cultural interchange are carried out on an interplanetary basis. An association of wealthy space merchants created the ""F-Zero Grand Prix"", in an attempt to add some excitement to their opulent lifestyles. When the first race was held, people were angered at the brutality of the competition, due to the various obstacles and traps along the raceway. As time passed, however, they became accustomed to these dangers, and even began to demand more excitement and danger in the races. Winning the F-Zero championship soon became the highest claim to fame in the universe. This period of time is called the ""old-school"" F-Zero days where the rules seemed non-existent in F-Zero X.F-Zero X's storyline starts after the seven-year suspension of Grand Prix races due to the Horrific Grand Finale. The game explains the ""Horrific Grand Finale"" was a violent and fiery accident that burnt fourteen drivers to death, including Sterling LaVaughn during the old days of F-Zero. A racer named Super Arrow escaped unscathed as the only survivor. No racing was allowed by the Federation after the crash; despite the F-Zero racing prohibition, the sport went underground where many racers went to hone their skills in secret. The crash ushered in the establishment of the ""F-Zero Racing Academy"", after a speech, by Super Arrow to the Federation Congress, which helped to lift the ban. The fictional competition was brought back with the rules and regulations revised.F-Zero: Maximum Velocity takes place twenty-five years after the SNES title in the year 2585. Players race against the descendants of the original F-Zero racers. Maximum Velocity is considered a reboot continuity to the rest of the home console titles since the game has made no indication of the safety revisions carried forth after the huge accident, in fact it states just like the original F-Zero game, the extreme danger involved when participating in those races.
F-Zero GX does not mention the Grand Finale event, but instead the game states Sterling LaVaughn was racing during the F-Max era and the F-Zero Grand Prix was suspended four years ago. This game states the character Mighty Gazelle was injured in the huge accident four years ago. The Nintendo 64 game mentions that Mighty Gazelle's accident and the accident that suspended the Grand Prix were two separate events.F-Zero: GP Legend is set in a different continuity and begins in the year 2201. It was continued with F-Zero Climax. These games feature some different incarnations of Captain Falcon, Zoda, and other characters.

Many video games have been lauded for their brilliant plots. The minimalist storytelling, yet heavy symbolism of Shadow of the Colossus, which says so little in dialogue, yet evokes so much emotion. The knee slapping satire of the first Bioshock against Randian Objectivism. The astounding amount of lore, world building, and background that went into the Elder Scrolls games, or Mass Effect. The lovable characters, excellent action, and vibrant imagination of the Final Fantasy games (well some of them). Then there is F-Zero. It was a decent racing game on the SNES. Why did it get an anime? Who the fuck knows?! 
 
Of all the oldschool video games to receive anime adaptations, I perhaps find this one the most baffling of all. Captain Falcon is a blast to play in Smash bros, but he isn't a character worth actually writing about, let alone watching. He isn't likeable in any way. He isn't interesting. He doesn't have a single character trait that makes me give a shit about watching something with him in it. This anime is also brought to us by 4kids Entertainment, so you can just guess what kind of QUALITY voice acting and brilliant Westernization you can look forward to. 
 
Here is the question you are probably asking: ""Why did I rate this as high as a 3?"" The reason is that after 51 boring, tedious, horrible fucking episodes this anime goes out with one of the most delicious crescendos in the history of animation. In classical music you have examples like the final segment of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture, The fourth movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, the beginning of Act 3 of Wagner's opera Die Walkure. In anime, you have Captain Falcon leaping out of a car traveling at light speed, screaming FARUKAN PANCHU, and punching a cheesy looking villain so fucking hard that it destroys a large portion of the God damned GALAXY! Absolutely brilliant. A single tear of pure joy slid down my cheek while taking in such a magnanimous segment of animated glory!

          
 
       Helpful Well, first review, don't expect anything wonderful from this. 
 
F-Zero: The Legend of Falcon is an alternate version of the mainline F-Zero video games in which I'm a fan. 
 
The Story is not entirely focused in the series mascot, our greatest bombastic hero Captain Falcon, but he's a key character of the events too. Instead, it focuses on the adventures of Ryu Suzaku, a man with a feud against a Criminal for a very, very long time, but that's only a little bit part of the series that I don't tell more, but also focuses on the other racers as well, while deviating things, some of the characters got better, ESPECIALLY Samurai Goroh and Black Shadow. 
 
The art and drawing is decent for early 2000's standards, but the maximum detail is in the cars, especially in the races, which is the central attractive of the anime series (Same as the games.), the use of CGI was decent. 
 
The soundtrack for the series is basically many tracks of the game in an epic format, a very strong point for being a throwback for the games, for example, Mute City, Big Blue, etc. 
 
I enjoyed the series so far, in fact, the finale became notorious for a Smash Bros. reference. 
 
I recommend the anime generally for fans of racing series and retro stuff, but also fellow F-Zero fans, too even if the protagonist is different.

          
 
       Helpful Let me be clear, I am a hardcore F-Zero fan. This anime is loosely based on the CHARACTERS of F-Zero instead of the story of F-Zero. Why? Because F-Zero never really had a plot. It took the series 13 years to give the characters back story. And what a back story they got. From superheros to supervillians, bounty hunters to intergalactic fed-ex employees to a disgruntled ex taxi driver using his cab as a racer. given these new intensive backstories, combined with the hardcore action and raw speed of the games, an F-Zero anime sounded like a great idea. 
 
       Where F-Zero GP Legend falls flat the most is story and the characters  in the anime. Ryu/Rick seems to have a pretty bad case of the Gary Stu syndrome early on, until you realize that he is useless. In fact, most of the characters are useless except for Captain Falcon. Jack Levin, a pop idol and member of a secret police force dedicated to shutting down the activities of several supervillians at all costs, gets his car jacked by some nobody that repaints it pink with flowers and enters the F-Zero race RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SECRET POLICE FORCE, WHO KNOW THAT THE CAR IS LEVIN'S. What do they do? They confront her before the race, she doesn't care, races, loses the race, gets cornered, and escapes, leaving the car behind. Most if not all the non-human racers form the games are reduced to petty goons regardless of backstory. all the characters seem about as deep as a puddle 3 sunny days after a storm. 
 
       This anime should have had a strong point in action and animation due to the natural sense of speed the games offered, but the mediocre animation never allows the pace anything faster than a brisk walk. Once, Ryu/Rick completely screws the pooch, and rolls his craft at MACH 2. Instead of the fiery crash I was expecting, the Dragon Bird sort of bounced upside down for a little bit and slid to a stop after cutting several times to an interior shot of a constipated looking Ryu/Rick. The sum total of the damage was a scratch that may or may not have been there. 
 
       I enjoyed this anime up until episode 17 or so, when the hilariously Engrish fansub I was watching suddenly became entirely incomprehensible so I switched to an English dub. This was a mistake. The dub I had chosen was the Stonestream dub, a fan made dub of ear-sodomy. after switching back to a sub that was of much better quality, I soon found the only source of  enjoyment was gone and I was forced to find another. I found this in the BGM. Compared to the rest of the anime, the BGM is a tasteful well done re-imagining of the source material. The original tunes from the games are remixed slightly. I recognized Fire Field, Mute City, Big Blue, and a few others. but these are really not enough since the rest of the SFX sounds laughably generic. 
  
        Overall, I really wanted this anime to be good, but it just isn't. I was so much better at F-Zero than making friends growing up. I was excited when I heard of this anime. but instead of the tasteful tribute of a beloved childhood friend, I got a gibbering oaf doing a puppet show with crayoned in cardboard cutouts.

Because of steam, the city is sometimes covered in a mist. Villains take advantage of the steamy mist to hide and execute their evil plans. Only a few dare venture into what's beyond the steamy mist. They are known as the Steam Detectives: Narutaki (and his convertible all-purpose pistol), his nurse-assistant Lingling, and his Megamaton robot Gohliki.

As the only source of energy, the steam engine has been the focus of technological advancement to the point where it can be substituted for any other form of power in modern technology. These same advancements also have given rise to Megamatons, large steam-powered robots. With the air of Steam City thick with fog and white smoke, thieves and criminals flourish with Megamatons as a common tool in their nefarious plans. It is here that the reader and/or viewer finds Narutaki, a young detective fighting for the peace of the city.
","Steam Detectives seems to be largely forgotten by the anime viewing fanbase. Not because it＊s bad by any stretch, since it seems to have a relatively small fanbase that enjoy it, but rather because it just never really stood out among the other anime coming out at the time. Especially considering that a lot of classic anime were coming out at the time, such as Cowboy Bebop and Serial Experiments Lain, along with popular cultural juggernauts such as Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, and Sailor Moon. 
 
Steam City is a city where the only fuel source is coal, and the only way to produce energy is a steam engine, thus all technological advancement involved coal in some capacity. As a result, the city is often covered in a mist, and many criminals use it to their advantage. These same advancements in technology has also given rise to Megamatons, large steam-powered robots. 
 
Our main character is Narutaki, a young detective who is also considered a child prodigy, who protects the city from various criminals, along with with his nurse-assistant Ling Ling, and his Megamaton robot named Gihliki. 
 
The series has a lot going for it. It＊s a steampunk detective show with an atmospheric noir theme to it, with a Sherlock Holmes influence, and it even has a few large robots that add some character to the series. Even the soundtrack is pretty decent. If anything, it feels like the younger brother of The Big O. 
 
It＊s very clearly aimed at a younger audience with it＊s simple characters and plot, but it never feels insulting or like it＊s talking down to it＊s audience. There are reoccurring plot and characters throughout the show that actually lead to an actual conclusion and the series doesn＊t really half-ass anything. The manga series that this is based on (which I actually recommend for the younger reading audience if they've taken an interest in this) was actually written by Kia Asamiya for his son, which I can respect. 
 
Steam Detectives might have been passed over a lot of people who were watching one of the numerous more popular shows at the time, but it＊s something that I think a few people could go back and watch and enjoy on some level, and I think that more than a few kids in the intended age rage might get something out of this series.

Mostly episodic, but with recurring villains whos story arcs are fleshed out over the entire series. The plot is serviceable, in that you know everyones motivations, and can follow the events well. Most episodes establish their own setting/characters, the villain makes his move, and Narutaki tries to stop him. 
 
The name suggests it's a detective show, but it's more like a cop drama because Narutaki takes a very hands-on approach to catching the criminals himself while his robot Goriki fights the criminals robots. There is some detective work, but the focus of the show is definitely the confrontations between Narutaki and the criminals

","To make it simple, it is very hardcore. I'd suggest that you do not watch it if you're not ready for the whole concept of sex and the like, because let me tell you that this has a lot of it. 
 
At first, I was simply excited as to what it was because the title was somewhat intriguing, but as I go through the middle, I ended up staring and then sometimes wondering what's been happening. The story overall is pretty good, though the ending was somewhat anti-climactic. 
 
This is a purely PWP (Porn Without Plot), so I don't suggest it to those under 16. Unless you think you're mature. ^^;

          
 
       Helpful Being that this is an OVA to a game title, I treat it as such: a supplement to the game. 
 
It's definitely not for the faint of heart as it contains very graphic (though censored) scenes of rape, sex, and sodomy. The mature content aside, the story is compelling and has good character development (although compressed to due to time constraints). 
 
If you want hardcore BL/yaoi, Enzai doesn't disappoint (believe me). The story is also enjoyable. 
 
This OVA only does well as a supplement to the game (as it is based on the game's ""good"" ending and as such can be seen as a spoiler of sorts).

          
 
       Helpful I don't know what entity propelled me to watch this, maybe it was my curiosity of what will be the ending or my masochism but I can't deny the fact that I watched it. 
 
It touches the boarders of shotacon and shitty character development. It could have been better if there were more episodes and so, so much LESS rape.  
What I'm trying to say is that if it focused more on the plot while telling the characters' stories then maybe, just maybe it would have been better. Actually it would, anything that doesn't involve so many fast pace ""tragedies"" and not focus only on the main character's problems. 
 
I know this anime was based upon a game so that made me want to know more about the characters that revolve around the protagonist because I just know that there's more to this story than just stealing, prison, rape, and corruption. 
 
 
Would I recommend this?  
No, not really. 
 
The story has potential  
The art is bearable but seeing as it was made on 2004 it can't be helped. 
The sound is fine nothing really commendable about it while the characters in the anime are dreadful I just know in my bones they were better in the game.

Every character had the same body type, there weren＊t any male characters but every female character was drawn with a male body-type: the torso was like an upside-down triangle (with large olives attached, as breasts), there was no curvature in the hips, and their legs looked like long, spindly noodles.  
 
〞In her original design, Lafy was one of the more colorful characters〞she was dark-skinned, had violet eyes, a star tattoo on her face, & a multi-colored afro. The Lafy in ＆Gall Force: The Revolution＊ looks like a sleazy, biker-bandit. She has leather, booty shorts and a halter top (with gaudy red, triangle tattoos under each of her eyes). Her hairstyle is even more atrocious: she wears a large black bandana on her head and has thin, rat-tail hair that goes down to her thighs. Ken'ichi Sonoda＊s Lafy often wore a (full-coverage) pilot suit and was still an enigmatic ＆80s icon. 
 
〞Catty was the all-knowing idealist with a light purple, swing bob. In ＆Gall Force: The Revolution,＊ she has the ugliest side burns in the world. They practically envelope her whole face. I have seen snow y身kai〞often referred to as ＆yuki-onna,＊ in other series, have the same blue side burns (i.e. Yukiko-Hime in Dororon Enma-kun and Oyuki in Urusei Yatsura) but Catty is an android that is the leader of a resistance organization and, subsequently, the martyr of the group〞it doesn＊t fit her personality. Catty has never been the ＆ice queen＊ type of character. 
 
〞Pony, originally, was a dark-skinned woman with short, wavy, lilac hair. In ＆Gall Force: The Revolution,＊ Pony is a flamboyant, bohemian blonde with fair skin & large flowers in her hair. The first iteration of Pony was deathly shy and brainy, but none of that is conveyed in the re-imagining of her character. The only part of Pony＊s character that remains faithful is her bond with android children in ＆Conch＊ because of her meek nature, she often bonded with androids and AI systems more than humans. 
 
?	Obviously, from many series from in the ＆90s (a prime example being Sailor Moon), anatomy was seen as more of a stylistic choice than a guideline. Even in earlier shows, like Rose of Versailles (1979), this was apparent〞Riyoko Ikeda gives all of her characters tall, ostrich necks. I don＊t mind improper anatomy in anime and cartoons, as long as it＊s not noticeable or ＆blends＊ into the mangaka＊s world. The designs in this DO NOT, especially if you have seen the first Gall Force OVA series prior to this one. 
 
?	Despite how wretched the characters look, this and ＆Rhea Gall Force＊ have the best stories in the franchise. A big issue that I had with the previous script writers, was that 90% of each OVA would be filled with exposition, ＆The Revolution＊ doesn＊t suffer as much from this issue. And while the previous installments were Ridley Scott-like escapades of surviving *alien attackers and stopping them from subsequently destroying the Earth. In ＆The Revolution,＊ it gets more political and focuses on the folly of war. 
*the aliens are referred to as ＆Paranoids.＊ 
 
?	In the beginning, Rabby and the girls are in a ＆*Solanoid＊ civil war in space. The two factions are called The East and West Force. Since this is a Japanese show, naturally, the girls are stationed on the side of The East Force. The leader (Commander Pfizer) is a buxom, green-haired woman who leads The East Force with an iron fist. After she reveals to Eluza (a pilot) that she has been developing an anti-matter cannon, Eluza＊s apprehension is immediately quelled by Pfizer＊s kiss and the two of them become lovers. Toward the end of the first OVA, Rabby discovers a rebel organization, led by Catty, called ＆Conch.＊ It＊s similar to To Terra＊s rebel group, lead by Solider Blue〞perhaps this is another reference, since Catty and Solider Blue both have pale blue hair. 
*Solanoid: what＊s left of humanity, after the galactic war with the aliens. 
 
?	After fighting breaks out amongst the factions, Catty sacrifices herself to save the rest of the cast and Pfizer reveals that there were never two factions and that the entire war was orchestrated by the puppet masters of both sides, referred to as ＆*The Executive Committee.＊ When confronted, Pfizer says that sacrifices must be made to maintain order and tries to get Eluza to join her. Eluza refuses, but then it is revealed that Pfizer has mind-controlled Patty and makes her attack her friends. In the end, Rabby and the others hack the control system and use the aforementioned anti-matter cannon to kill Pfizer, ending her tyranny once and for all. The group then decides to return to Earth and start over, a parallel to the end of the Gall Force 1: Eternal Story. 
*more or less a one world government. 
 
?	Gall Force has never been known for having strong characters but it was a relief that Eluza had a small character moment in the last OVA. Despite how solid the story was〞the other characters were more or less props to move the plot along. It like that in Eternal Story, too. In that one: there was fanservice, one of the girls would get picked off, and then another plot twist would come around〞like clockwork. I know that fans love the ＆aesthetic＊ of the original Gall Force OVAs but strip them of the pretty visuals and there＊s nothing more than a mirror of every other American sci-fi, action flick from the ＆80s. 
 
?	Gall Force: The Revolution has a solid plot, minimal exposition, and a good soundtrack. I would say that it＊s worth a watch if you＊re not completely repulsed by the ugly character designs. It＊s considered obscure because it never got licensed in the US and had a limited release in Japan but it＊s something worth looking into. I give it a 6/10. 


          
 
       Helpful (Pardon for my English, it's not my native language) 
A rare OVA, last in Gall Force series line, has it's own problems and dignities. 
The Revolution is just simply retelling the plot of first three shows of Gall Force (Eternal Story, Destruction, Stardust War). Of course, this retelling is inexact. There are a few new lines in a show, and a new ending, a happy one, which is unusual for Gall Force. Almost every previous OVA has a downer ending. And therefore this is the only GF show without the main plotline of the whole series - the cyclic character of civilisation progress, from one catastrophe to another. 
This isn't bad after all, but now it's just another save-the-world story. 
The character design is typical for 90's, something similar to Saber Marionettes or Nadesico chardis. Which is also not bad, but old 80's designs by Sonoda are just look better.  
Mechanical design is 100% identical to first GF movie, so, for the good, there is nothing new and unusual. 
OPs&EDs are forgettable but voice acting is really nice: the seiuus do their work right. After all, we have great VA like Kotono Mitsuishi and Kikuko Inoue at work. :-) 
 
Overall, this is a fair show, entertaining and with simple storyline. It worth it's screentime, but rewatching this... I don't think so.

16,209,48,5.83935414,Detective and his or her helper,R.O.D: The TV,"Anita King, Maggie Mui, and Michelle Cheung are the Paper Sisters. They run the Three Sisters Detective Agency in Hong Kong which is dedicated to solving cases involving books. They are hired as local guides for Nenene Sumiregawa, a Japanese novelist who has been struggling with writer's block following the disappearance of her longtime friend, Yomiko Readman. The sisters are all Paper Masters〞individuals with the power to control paper〞and with their abilities, they save Nenene from the dangerous terrorists targeting her at a book signing. But in case they strike again, the sisters remain as her bodyguards to protect her from further harm. 
 
This is a dream come true for bookworms Maggie and Michelle who love Nenene's stories, but the young Anita cannot stand books despite her powers over paper. The three struggle to adapt to their new daily life in Japan, guarding Nenene while continuing their detective work under a mysterious organization, Dokusensha. However, the more they get to know Nenene, the more they discover the link between her, the disappearance of her friend Yomiko, and the mysterious books Dokusensha sends the Paper Masters to investigate. What began as a simple job ends up a bigger case than they have ever had before. Are these girls really willing to risk their lives over literature? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Drama']","The series begins in 2006, five years after the ""I-Jin"" incident detailed in the Read or Die OVA. Yomiko Readman (a.k.a. ""The Paper"", agent of British Library Task Force) has supposedly gone missing, and Nenene Sumiregawa, her former student and best friend, is still in Tokyo after her parents moved to the United States. Nenene has not written a book since Yomiko disappeared, as she has become lonely and frustrated that her sensei has never read her last book, and she feels she can't write again until she hears Yomiko's reaction to the book, so Nenene often disappears for long periods of time searching for Yomiko, and has been periodically doing so ever since her ""disappearance"".
During a trip to Hong Kong, Nenene meets the three sisters, Michelle, Maggie and Anita (from the Read or Dream manga), who are supposed to take care of her during her visit. However, the hotel at which Nenene is supposed to stay at is bombed, and at a press conference Nenene is briefly held hostage by a jealous rival in her industry. The three sisters end up becoming her bodyguards and join her back to Tokyo.
Each sister has paper manipulation skills similar to Yomiko, although less powerful and more focused in scope. After the initial action-filled adventure, the first several episodes take on the feel of an odd-couple comedy which focuses on tension between Nenene and the sisters, who move into her apartment and mooch off her, all while dealing with various crazies and psychos in their everyday lives. The sisters also perform odd jobs as agents of the Dokusensha (ostensibly a Chinese publishing company, but more like an Illuminati-type organization focusing on the collection of rare and powerful documents). This eventually puts them and Nenene in direct conflict with the British Library and the protagonists of Read or Die (Dokusensha is established as the British Library's rival in the Read or Die manga).
Events grow more serious as the series progresses as atrocities are committed by both sides, thrusting the main characters into the middle of a conflict between literary superpowers, the British Library and Dokusensha, who are both trying to collect ancient artifacts (books, of course) to control the entire world and even rewrite history. After a horrific collision between the two superpowers, Nenene and the Paper Sisters set out to find the missing Yomiko to learn the truth about the conflict and save the world from literary terrorism.
","ROD gives me an impression of creativity, using paper as a weapon, clothes and practical stuff is impressive. also having these characters like anita to find a family in the likes of michelle and maggie. nenene for trying to find the precious person that keeps her inspired and also for yomiko and nancy who in spite of their clumsiness still charms the viewers. i like this anime because of its story, action scenes and unexpected love story between friends

          
 
       Helpful Remember last time last year, when I watched an OVA called Mezzo Forte and I thought that was one of the many entertaining anime I had ever saw and then after that, I＊ve reviewed Mezzo DSA, the TV series to follow it and I thought the TV series was very bland and vanilla compared to the OVA, offering nothing to the table aside from a few basics from the OVA. Well, I was very cautious when going into the Read or Die franchise as I know a few friends of mine said that OVA is very underrated and I wholeheartedly agree about. Now with this TV series, that might say the opposite that it isn＊t as good as the OVA but hey, who knows? I might find a different opinion on it.

As I watched the series, I will know there will be additional characters made into main characters from the aforementioned manga and the plot expands to more than just 3 episodes (to a full 26 episodes) and I only have half enthusiastic  when I was watching this. The plot of this is as like the OVA but it＊s sliced and diced to either the average bad guy of the week to these character pieces that are more akin to the slice-of-life genre with one part being Anita in middle school (or it is high school? I couldn＊t really tell. They looked way too young to be high school.) but it just feel odd and jarring as most characters from the first half disappears and then appears from out of the blue and/or a long time period for forced character development, which just puts me out of interest altogether. 
  
  
  
Funny thing about the main 3 sister characters, all of them are named after Hong-Kong action actresses, hence Anita King (Anita Mui), Maggie Mui (Maggie Cheung, part of Anita Mui) & Michelle Cheung (Michelle Yeoh, part of Maggie Cheung) but yet, the fact is the only thing that is interesting about them as they aren＊t that strong as characters but more of anime archetypes: Anita being the youngest but the most capable and often more focused on than the other sisters, Maggie being the quiet and silent one, and Michelle is the cheerful, older yet ditzy sister. Throughout the show, they do go through this sisterhood bond with another new character in the mix, Nenene Sumiregawa and yet, she is a very irritable and screechy character, whose only reason to appear in this is because she has a connection to the earlier master Yomiko Readman and yes, most of the characters from the OVA do appear in here, including Joker, Drake & Nancy, but if you＊re expecting the femme fatale Nancy was in the OVA, prepare to be disappointed, as it was explained that she did suffer some brain trauma that had her in a childlike state. 
  
  
  
The animation here as in the OVA, Studio Deen did the previous one, while in the TV series, they are replaced with J.C. Staff for this time and it was just＃＃average. The paper battles were very spot-on with the previous installment although they appear within long periods of time. Character designs are actually faithful as I can＊t spot the differences of how they were designed. The music is still the best part of the franchise as it still retains the spirit of the OVA and it even got more funkier when the opening theme for the show. Plus, the original themes from the OVA among other pieces are heard in there. I can say less for the ending themes as they are standard pop songs that seemed forgettable. 
  
  
  
Fuck it, this English dub is bad and I mean it was grating as like the animation, the voice actors from the Manga dub was replaced by company Geneon / New Generation Pictures and most of them tried to do British accents and some can＊t do it well, especially the replacement actress for Yomiko (Hellena Taylor), Joker (J.B. Blanc) & Junior (J.D. Stone) and some of the main female character voices are often shrilly and screechy, mostly Nenene＊s voice.  However, I＊m not going to fault the dub that much as they did hire kid actors to play the younger characters and if you try to find some recognizable voice actors in there, the only people whose voices I got from there are Hunter MacKenzie Austin (playing Michelle), Carrie Savage (replacing Amanda-Winn Lee for Nancy Mukahari) & Patrick Seitz. 
  
  
  
FINAL VERDICT: The show isn＊t wholly unfaithful to the OVA, the spirit of that is still present in the TV series but I just don＊t think it was ready for a TV format, even the plot as ridiculous in the OVA seems better suited to that. Mainly one character left somewhat of an impact of the show, only 50% less than Yomiko. I wouldn＊t say it＊s inferior to the OVA but it＊s nothing that most people would say when talking about most anime out there. By any chance, you should stream or rent before buying. 
  


          
 
       Helpful R.O.D the TV soars above it's manga equivalent, Read or Dream, in terms of strong story and well developed characters, even bringing back several popular characters from the past.  While the two host the same primary characters, the plot line of the tv series takes on a whole different path from the manga, and I must say that it was a brilliant choice.  Although the series overall is rather slow to develop, it all results in an amazing ending climax and resolution that is well worth viewing for oneself. 
 
Do note that it is not necessary to know anything about the Read or Die setting previous to this series to be able to follow it, although many elements do tie in with the past. 
 
Story:  9 
This story centers around several bibliophile sisters (and one who hates books) who are able to animate paper, and their various day to day life, as well as the missions they go upon.  Later on in the series, the story takes on a much more epic scale, and everything involving the sisters and the people they are involved with all comes together in a grand fashion that has the potential to all fall apart, but manages to stick and finish well. 
 
Again, I'll try to avoid comparisons to the manga, but first I shall mention that I found the character designs to be greater in the anime series; the portrayal of the Paper Sisters is better executed and personalities are well defined in a manner that the manga lacked. 
 
In terms of story progression, the first episode should give you a pretty good feel of what the series is like.  The first few episodes are somewhat uneventful in terms of heavy action as they're used to introduce you to the main characters and their personalities, but the pace starts to pick up around the fourth ep. when they start taking on some missions and Anita starts school.  Episode 12 marks the start of the real focus of the story, and after a recollection of the events that were involved in the original Read or Die and tie in with R.O.D the TV in Episode 14, the true plot line unfolds (as well as the return of a certain Paper Master).  The series definitely takes its time in delivering the full story, and although many episodes could easily be cut, overall, I found the shifting between the slower, more character development-centered parts (edging toward the slice of life genre) and the more story-driven, action oriented parts to be appealing and rather enjoyable. 
 
R.O.D just has this really relaxed feel to it, which blends well with the action sequences surprisingly.  The main characters maintain their personalities well whether relaxing reading books or animating paper on a serious mission. 
 
The way that the plot progresses is comparable to a train starting up; it starts out really slow and slowly begins to pick up speed, until it progresses into an all out (I'd feel rather awkward saying 'full steam ahead') race to the finish that is just impossible to stop watching.  While the story does take quite a few rather creative liberties when the real action begins, overall the story packs a solid punch that delivers in the end. 
 
I should mention that the series does contain a small amount of nudity, but nothing too major (namely Episode 9). 
 
Art:  9 
If the animation for the series has one thing, it's consistency.  The animation is fluid and well done throughout the entire series; the flow of hundreds of sheets of paper everywhere is quite a sight to see.  The series delivers on the action scenes, and is easy to follow and impressive to watch.  Character design is clean and simple, although they are defined aptly, and it is easy to distinguish one character from another.  The anime refrains from using any super deformed styles such as simplified faces or chibi to convey emotions, and rather uses dialogue, superb voice acting, and well drawn faces to create an effect.  However, they do sometimes use blush spots on cheeks to make the characters look cute at times, and while it is a bit out of place, it is far better than the common use of &gt;&lt; eyes and such to translate feelings.  The backgrounds at times are simply beautiful, as are the cloud designs.  Overall, the art is rather solid. 
 
Sound:  8 
One thing I should mention, regarding voice acting, I watched the english dubbed version for a while, and I have to say that it wasn't too bad.  It takes a bit of getting used to at first, but some voices are just spot on, such as the brilliant voicing of Nenene, which provides a perfect fit to her character.  In fact, when I went back to subs, I found that I actually preferred the English voices, with a few exceptions (i.e. Hisa's voice).  And that's saying something, as I generally prefer Japanese with subtitles to dubbing. 
 
The ending theme is very fitting to the series, as I find it reflective of the relationship of the Paper Sisters.  The ending changes after Episode 13, halfway through the series, and although I liked the new ending, I found that it did not fit quite as well as the first. 
 
The OP is a lyric-free jazz piece similar to ones found in Cowboy Bebop, or something that you'd hear in a James Bond-type movie, and is also used several times during action scenes.  The music played throughout the series fits the atmosphere and helps to define it, and although the music is sometimes started awkwardly in some scenes, it is all very fitting. 
 
Character:  10 
Perhaps R.O.D's strongest point is its character relationships.  The chemistry between the three sisters is realistic and gripping, as are the friendships they form with many of the other main characters of the series.  Every character possesses strong unique qualities that define each, and they stick by them consistently throughout, while simultaneously developing and growing as people.  The characters' traits and the way they act are deeply ground in reality and it is easy to visualize any of them living in the real world (minus the supernatural elements, of course).  All have vastly differing appearances; there is no risk of ever mixing up characters for one another.  While many of the characters' pasts are not deeply delved into, although at the moment I cannot confirm, I believe that they are addressed in earlier installments of the Read or Die universe.  However, the three main characters receive plenty of background information that is slowly revealed throughout the story and make them stronger as a whole.  The characters of R.O.D are part of what makes this story so great. 
 
Enjoyment:  10 
R.O.D the TV delivers a unique story that any anime fan should check out.  The story is unique and refreshing and the characters are both memorable and likable.   The general atmosphere of the series may not be for everyone, but I feel that this is a rather under-appreciated anime and everyone should at least give it a chance.  Despite its slow and steady pace, this series manages to stay compelling and kept me hooked all the way through up to the end. 
 
Overall:  9 
Although I feel that the series does fall a little short as it takes a bit too much time in the beginning, those who are patient will be rewarded with a great story and characters if they stick with the series.  My best advice would be to at least check out the first episode and see what you think as it gives a pretty good idea as to what R.O.D is like.  If you happen to like the Read or Dream, or Read or Die manga, then you should check out this anime for sure.

If the rules of the contract are followed, everything goes fine, but if someone should break the rules of the contract, the pet shop cannot be held responsible for anything unfortunate that might happen. Leon Orcot, a homicide detective, has linked many odd and unexplainable deaths together; they all were customers of Count D's pet shop, and he intends to find out why.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Horror', 'Josei', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']","""Count D"" is the mysterious caretaker of a pet shop in Los Angeles Chinatown. Each of D's rare pets, which all have strangely humanoid appearances, comes with a contract with three major points. These points differ for each animal sold (although each animal's contract includes not showing it to anyone), and breaking this contract usually results in dire (and sometimes disturbing) consequences for the buyer, for which the pet shop claims no liability.
Individual chapters of Pet Shop of Horrors are often based on these consequences, and are each written as a stand-alone story, usually introducing one or more new characters in each chapter. With the exception of the main characters and their families, it is rare for a character to carry over to a later chapter, providing the series with a very episodic nature.
The detective Leon Orcot is used to tie the chapters together into an ongoing plot, usually in the form of a subplot within each chapter. Initially he suspects D of malicious criminal activity and using the pet shop as a front for drug trafficking. As the series progresses, he learns more about the pet shop and D himself, entering into a strange friendship of sorts with D as he works to uncover the truth.
","What a fun little show.  4 episodes of about 22 minutes each.  It didn't really feel like an anime but it was still good.  It could best be described as a mix of Needful Things and Tales From the Crypt.  Not really eerie or creepy but more of a show of human nature and people getting their just desserts when they follow their desires with little regard for the rules.

          
 
       Helpful For any fans of Tales from the Crypt, this is most definitely the anime for you. Each episode follows a different character who has visited the pet shop. This 4 episode OVA is filled with creepy and spooky tales, and at the end of the episode, you may just learn a lesson or moral from each story. 
 
Story 
 
Pet Shop of Horrors is about a strange gothic young man named Count D who manages a pet shop. However, this is no average pet shop. At this pet shop you can find a wide variety of 'rare' and 'exotic' animals. All you need to do is sign a contract with this man, and it's yours. However, you may find these rules hard to abide with, and end up with a disaster in which even death may occur.  
 
I'm a big fan of episodic series, so this anime was definitely a hit for me. Each story was creepy and interesting, and the animal the characters ordered corresponded with the owners inner demons and troubles.What really got me interested was that at the end of each episode, a very interesting moral was taught. That was probably my favorite aspect of the show, besides the spooky ominous feel to it.  
 
I also found the concept of this series very unique. The idea of a creepy 'animal' from a pet shop to move a long an entire story really intrigued me. I love animals, and like to learn about mystical creatures, so when I saw the title, I was automatically drawn in. This series definitely did not disappoint. Even with my high expectations, Pet Shop of Horrors exceeded them with its eerie tales of the characters dark pasts and their new pet which may in the end teach them a lesson. 
 
Animation 
 
Pet Shop of Horrors was released in 1999, so the animation is quite dated. I went into the story with low expectations of the art, but I was actually surprised. Yes, the animation was definitely not the best, but it was fitting, and was actually very well done for its time. It was also very unique in a way as well. There was no set style or pattern I could find. For example Count D and the detective Leon, have a totally different style. With the Count, his features were very pointed while Leon's were much more realistic and better shaded. This goes for not only these two, but for many other characters as well. 
 
The character designs were pretty interesting as well, especially the Count. His tall, yet feminine figure added to his mysterious personality, along with his painted long nails, dark lips always in a small smile, and his hetereochromic eyes narrowed at you. The creature designs were interesting and haunting as well. This anime would have been a flop without the creepy and spooky animation. 
 
Sound 
 
There's not to much music in this anime, but nothing felt out of place or unfitting. When there was music, it only added to the dark atmosphere. No music needed to be added or deleted, and it felt as if everything was in order.  
 
As for voice acting, it was very well done. I personally watched the dub, and each voice matched the character perfectly. I especially liked the Count's voice actor, as he sounded very calm and collected even while delivering disturbing lines, which built up the Count's character even more, and added to his eerie aura. Considering the importance and amount of dialogue the Count has, it was very important to have an excellent voice actor, which is another thing Pet Shop of Horrors did very well 
 
Characters 
 
Since Pet Shop of Horrors is episodic, there is a large variety of characters, but does not feel overcrowded since each set is different in each episode. The only characters which remained throughout was Count D, the tall dark mysterious pet shop owner, and Leon Orcot, the hot headed detective suspects the Count for the recent string of murders, and is determined to expose Count D for his crimes.Leon acts as an extra viewpoint, and as a piece to help dig up the other characters backgrounds. 
 
As for the customers and main characters of an episode, they all seem to have a dark past or secret which indirectly causes them to end up at the Count's shop to fulfill their desires through their new pet. As each episode progresses we learn more and more about each character, and finally discover who they really are. At the end of each episode, these characters' backstories and mistakes serve as a lesson or moral to the story.  
 
Overall 
 
Overall, Pet Shop of Horrors gets a solid 9 out of 10. This short series was a psychological horror masterpiece, and deserves to be appraised for its thought provoking spooky stories. This show is definitely one of my favorites and is a must watch for any psychological or horror fan.

          
 
       Helpful When compared side-by-side with the manga of the same name, the Pet Shop of Horrors anime suddenly looks shoddy and duct-taped together. However, as a stand-alone anime it is very unique. 
 
Each episode can be watched without having any background knowledge of the series, as they are all their own story, similar to anime such as pokemon were it is easy to jump in at any point in the series. However, this is also a drawback, as were there should be a pause to explain something further or in more detail, the show chugs along over it, crossing its fingers and hoping that the audience will understand. 
 
As dark anime go, Pet Shop of Horror doesn't necessarily have a unique concept, but the overall story is unique. It's easy to become lost in the episodes, which provide a unique &quot;this-could-really-happen&quot; sense that few others manage to achieve. 
 
The animation leaves something to be desired, however, with even the Japanese, English-subbed version looking like a terrible American dub. The background music is interesting, but the anime also keeps things quiet were there should be ambient noise such as birds, cars, even the wind. 
Character development is limited, but as the series is so short it's not so much that they didn't bother, its that there simply isn't enough time to get to know the characters and watch them grow. 
 
Overall, if you watch anime for the music or animation then this isn't for you. Fans of the manga, be prepared as these episodes are based almost word-for-word on stories from the first three volumes.

Out of nowhere, a group of thugs and a monster show up. A detective, Seiji Hayama, rescues Honey and her father. Unfortunately, the monster captures Honey`s father. A grieving Honey goes home to find it in ruins, but a handsome man gives her hope and a device to use against the monsters who took her father. With them, Honey can transform into multiple forms and destroy Panther Zora, the evil behind this.  
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shoujo']","Honey Kisaragi is a 16-year-old perfectly normal, beautiful high school student... until her scientist father is kidnapped by the evil organization Panther Claw, that is. However, her father left behind a device that she can use to transform into the red-haired sword-wielding heroine, Cutie Honey.  Aided by Seiji Hayami, a private eye who specializes in Panther Claw, and the mysterious ""Twilight Prince"", she fights members of Panther Claw in order to rescue her father.
","I totally love Cutey Honey. She's tough and not afraid to be sexy. And even though she was one of the first magical girls, she stands out just as much as a unique character as she did in the 80s. Most versions of her story are pretty similar only to each other. There's one major outlier, though: Cutey Honey Flash. 
 
As the series that took over Sailor Moon's timeslot when it first aired, Cutey Honey Flash is not the ecchi/action sort of magical girl series you'd expect from the franchise, instead following a more typical formula. It takes place in high school, it's totally family-friendly, and It's very episodic. In every episode, Honey and her friends start out doing something typical of teen girls (or at least what little girls wish that their teenage years would be like). Then (rather underdeveloped) evil strikes, and Honey has to transform and fight evil. There's an underlying plot, of course -- in this one, Honey is trying to rescue her missing father -- and a mysterious yet helpful man (sound familiar?). It's far from unpleasant, but it's very much your typical magical girl plot and atmosphere. Rather underwhelming, really, and while I understand that the intention was to give Sailor Moon a spiritual successor, Cutey Honey Flash doesn't bring anything new to the table to make it stand out from Sailor Moon and other similar series. 
 
Still, Cutey Honey Flash retains a decent amount of the charm in other versions. While Honey is meeker in this version, she's still a strong character, both in the sense of being well-characterized and the sense of kicking a lot of butt. A version of the classic theme song is used as the opening, along with Honey's costume being a variation of the original. Honey still has her transforming abilities, too; she solves problems brought by the villains by transforming into different types of people. It can indeed fun to watch the traditional components of the original Cutey Honey mixed with your standard magical girl tropes, and I'm glad that even in a different genre, Cutey Honey Flash still has some of what makes other versions great. 
 
Full disclosure: I only understand English, and this review is for those who are in the same boat as me and wondering if they should try out this series anyway. Cutey Honey Flash has only been fansubbed up to the ninth episode, with little sign of more coming up. It may become a very different show in the next thirty episodes, but for now they aren't available. For now, it's a solid but not fabulous watch for magical girl fans who don't mind seeing every 90s trope in the book, and Cutey Honey fans who also enjoy more traditional shoujo.

          
 
       Helpful Given the username, it should be apparent that I＊m a big fan of Cutie Honey. The series is known for its violence, nudity, fanservice, but especially for the titular heroine, Honey Kisaragi. It＊s a classic tale of a sexy, superpowered android who sets out to avenge the death of her father from the evil crime syndicate known as Panther Claw. As one might guess from my description, it was originally a shounen, the demographic of manga and anime aimed at younger and teenaged boys--the first shounen magical girl series, to be exact! Honey is a mahou shoujo pioneer who would pave the way for later series that would actually be aimed at young women rather than young men. You remember how Minky Momo could transform into anyone she wanted, and the transformation pen in Sailor Moon which would essentially serve the same fuction? Honey did it first. You remember the often sexually-charged female monsters of the day from Sailor Moon? Honey did it first. Never mind the fact that Cutie Honey was essentially the first ※magical girl warrior§ anime, which would eventually become subgenre dominated by the shoujo demographic (Sailor Moon, Wedding Peach, Tokyo Mew Mew, Precure, etc.). This just goes to show how much Honey would come to shape the genre, so if I told you that some of staff from Sailor Moon would take a shot at a shoujo Cutie Honey anime--one that would be aimed at the Sailor Moon demographic, being younger girls, would you be surprised by that? You actually probably shouldn＊t be! 
 
So, what is it that sets Flash apart from the rest of the franchise, aside from the obvious? Well, quite a bit, actually. The story starts out very similarly to that of the original anime from the 70s. Honey sneaks out of school to go see her father, and when she comes to find him, he is being kidnapped by Panther Claw (he＊s not dead this time). At the end of the first episode, she discovers that she is the superheroine, Cutie Honey. However, instead of being told all of this by her father by a pre-set recording like in the original, she is told by a mysterious, long, silky-haired dreamboat who she calls ※the Twilight Prince§. Yes, this tall, dark, and handsome man does serve as a guide to Honey at the beginning of the series in a role like that of Tuxedo Mask＊s from Sailor Moon. However, he is NOT a Tuxedo Mask clone. I just thought I＊d get that out of the way. This anime starts out in a way that makes it seem uninspired and cookie-cutter, but as the story progresses, there are many twists and turns that are quite unexpected. Characters aren＊t always as they appear to be at first and things are not quite as they seem. It is something that must be given a proper chance.  
 
What＊s neat about Cutie Honey F is that while there are your usual episodic monster-of-the-week episodes as there would be in any show like this, there are little noticeable arcs throughout the course of the series. As much as I love Sailor Moon, you can go for episodes with just filler and little to no development. With Cutie Honey F, it felt like there was some kind of development or progress in more episodes than there were not, and that＊s just so refreshing to me. This is probably largely in part due to its 39-episode runtime, but it＊s still very refreshing. Some of you might be wondering how Honey herself differs from her character in the rest of the franchise. I don＊t think she differs much at all, really! Sure, of course she was ※sexed down§ a bit given the audience, but she is still authentically Honey, no doubt about it! She＊s cunning, mischievous, noble, and unapologetically herself! Think less Usagi from Sailor Moon, and more Maron from Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne! 
 	 
I＊ll be honest and say everybody feels a bit more kind and ※human§ in Cutie Honey F when compared to their original coutnerparts. Mr. Danbei is the goofy, kind-hearted principal who shows no perverted qualities like in the original, and Ms. Histler is Honey＊s teacher who actually comes to care for her when push comes to shove. While this is a significant departure from their original characters, I like these more sympathetic renditions of them. It＊s actually a nice change. In this version, Seiji is a hapless detective and lovable dork that lives in a rundown apartment, and serves as the main love interest to Honey. He＊s sweet and goofy, but most importantly, a helpful sidekick who＊s very supportive of Honey. He isn＊t a horndog who＊s immediately taken by her looks like in the original, and he even denies having feelings for her many times, as does Honey. As a result, their relationship takes more time to develop. As you might expect, the romance is played up in this version, largely due to the demographic change, but I think that＊s fitting specifically for that reason. You may think this ※will they, or won＊t they§ dynamic sounds annoying, but fear not! Their relationship is taken to the next level in more ways than one, and that＊s something you don＊t often see in other magical girl anime of this nature. There is significant development between them that ultimately makes this slow burner romance worth the wait! 
 
The animation in Cutie Honey F varies depending on the episode. Some episodes look better than others, and some look worse than others, but, ultimately, it looks like a shoujo magical girl anime from the late 1990s. It＊s art and animation is very comparable to that of Sailor Moon＊s, which makes sense, as the character designer and animation director for Cutie Honey F, Miho Shimogasa, worked on some of the Key Animation and animation direction for every season of Sailor Moon. If you＊ve seen Sailor Moon, you know what to expect animation quality-wise. As expected with this kind of anime, the aesthetic is very bright and stereotypically feminine, which I find to be very appealing, though your mileage may vary.  
 
Cutie Honey F＊s music is great. As one would expect, the opening theme is the classic Cutie Honey intro song that everybody knows, so it＊s hard to go wrong there. The bgm is fun, and each track is helpful in complementing what's going on on-screen. Action scenes get fast-tempo jazz, while a soft, emotional  scenes might use this version＊s revamp of the classic ※Yogiri no Honey§, the ending theme to the original 1970s anime. Each track is utilized almost perfectly to fit the scene. 
 
Cutie Honey F is by far the most underrated Cutie Honey anime there is, hands down. For years, the series hadn＊t been entirely fansubbed, as there was little demand for it. It＊s true that most fans don＊t turn to Cutie Honey for shoujo elements, so this series just wasn＊t quite as sought after. However, by this year, 2019, it was completely fansubbed in all of its glory, so dedicated mahou shoujo and Cutie Honey fans alike can enjoy it in all of its entirety! It＊s a shame that this series is often overlooked when talking about Cutie Honey anime and magical girl anime in general. It may just seem like they were using a classic property to ride off of the massive success that Sailor Moon had in the early to late 90s, but I don＊t believe that＊s the case. It does enough interesting things and packs enough of a punch on its own, and some fairly unconventional directional choices were made for an anime of this nature. I think Cutie Honey F deserves just a bit more credit, at least for it＊s attempt to do something entirely different for a franchise classically aimed at young men, if not for the heart and ambition put behind it.  
 
P.S. Shoutout to my friend ImperialSympathizer for taking the time to sub this series to completion! Now more fans will be able to enjoy this hidden gem!

","The main character, Momosuke, is a young writer whose ambition is to create an anthology of disturbing stories and mysterious country tales.

The young author joins their travels and witnesses just how corrupt can people get. On his way he'll have to question his own morality, as  the trio's ways of treating their &quot;victims&quot; is very cruel both mentally and physically. 
 
Art is what dragged me into the anime. Just as the story dives into the darkness of human souls, the art gives the atmosphere. Hundred Stories does not have your typical style. Very few characters look like normal poeple - most are deformed in one way or another, the surroundings are dark and often quite literally twisted, setting the mood for all the disturbing things the viewer is about to witness. And beleive me - many scenes here are pretty graphic, so don't even touch this anime if you can't stand the sight of blood and voilence. 
 
To summarize, if you're looking for a happy, warm anime, stay away. On the other hand, if you enjoy taking a trip into twisted darkness, don't mind blood and gore and love sinister plot twists, this is an anime you've been looking for. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Hundred stories, More commonly known as &quot;Requiem From the Darkness&quot; is a horror anime like no other. 13 episodes of the most disturbing and gory stories you'll ever witness. The basic plot of the story is about a young man who is an author journeying to lands where there are mysterious rumors in order to write a book of 100 Japanese horror stories. Every time he encounters the supernatural though he runs into a group of the &quot;Exorcists&quot; traveling Japan to destroy the darkness in people's hearts. 
 
Story: Each episode is a separate story in another village, but even though its &quot;Episodic&quot; the relationship between main characters is still developing. Most episodes start with a very disturbing scene, usually a brutal murder that hints at the &quot;Darkness&quot; behind the episode~ it really pulls you in from episode one~ The first half is setting the stage and characters for the story and how the main character the author meets them. The second half of the episode is discovering the malignant evil in the perpetrator~ catching him commit his crime, and then the exorcists killing him in some manner.  
 
What really sets this apart from other anime is the length it went to in shock value; most episodes revolve around the murder, rape, and or plain torture of women and small children...And the story is played out in a way you never see it coming~ Be warned that this is Rated R for these reasons... if you have a weak constitution to gore or horror in general I wouldn't advise you watch this series. No matter how much you think &quot;They're not going to show it... they're going to pane away...&quot; they do show it... generally in the most gruesome manner and in slow motion. 
 
Art: The art is very... &quot;Original&quot; I guess~ It is not Standard animation which gives it a nice flair sometimes~ But on some occasions the animation is just so overdone in its unique style that it doesn't look nice on the eyes, or you don't even know whats happening.  
 
Sound: The opening and ending are nice, I don't know if they really match with the feeling of the anime, but they're ok; the ending is very calming... which may be something you need to hear after some of the crazy conclusions to episodes. The OST music didn't stick out very much, but it wasn't poorly done at least and it effectively portrayed the mood. 
 
Character: The main character balance is a little off; they were original I suppose, but the story almost flows without their presence since each episode is about the episodic characters than the main characters usually (Similar to Jigoku Shoujo).  
 
Enjoyment: 95% of the episodes were original and had me on the edge of my seat. They broke so many expectation barriers on Gore... and even more socially taboo things which I will leave as teasers for people who haven't seen the show. If you're more of a fluffy luv luv anime lover, or want some luls... this definitely is not the anime for you~ But if you're thirsting blood and hellish plot twists this anime is right up your alley.

He gets fed up with his profession and decides to explore the country all over and write a hundred ghost stories which he later, decides to publish as a series of novels.

He is a charm-caster by profession, who sells talismans to people. He is a mysterious short guy who resembles a mummy by looks and always carries a staff, like a priest. His behavior is depicted as that of a calm-minded, quiet and reserved gentleman, who doesn＊t like to talk much.

o Nagamimi: In the series, he is called a ＆Shapeshifter＊ as it is seen that he possesses the ability to change himself into anything. He always keeps smiling, which makes him look weirder than he already is. He is pictured as a tall and stout man with a good muscular physique who always carries a long pipe with him in his mouth. He has the duty to act as the medium that brings the entire case in the light. 
 
? Tsutaya: He is a small chubby creature who is Momosuke＊s publisher. At the start, he Is shown to be pissed by the change in the decision of Momosuke to stop writing the riddles for children, but later, he agrees to aid the protagonist in his work.

The chief engineer suspects that the train's test run will be used for illicit purposes and hires private detective Ban Shunsaku. He arrives to his client's mansion only to find that he has just been murdered. Armed with just a glimpse of the murderer's face, Shunsaku boards the Marine Express to get to the bottom of this mystery. This job, however, is much more than what he bargained for, as the train holds secrets beyond anyone's imagination. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama']","The plot of Marine Express can be described in two parts. The first and longer part focuses on the people boarding the train and the problems they encounter on it. The second part takes place after the train has stopped at its half-way point, an island that used to be home to an ancient civilization millennia ago and has its fair share of secrets.
","Let me get this straight; If you're not a fan of Tezuka, don't watch this movie, you won't like it. 
 
However, if you ARE a fan of Tezuka, then welcome aboard the Marine Express! 
A mystery sci-fi action movie, it's quite the ride! Starring Tezuka's most famous characters from his Star System including classic characters such as Shunsaku Ban, Atom, Rock, Leo, Black Jack, and much, MUCH more! The plot is very interesting, let me try to explain it without spoiling the movie.  
 
So we're first introduced to this Inspector character names Shunsaku Ban, who is investigating a man who claimed to have some secretive knowledge, but when Shunsaku arrives at the scene, he sees the man dead, and shortly afterward, the body melt before his eyes and a person escaping! Shunsaku follows in pursuit, only to be knocked out. Shunsaku is saved thanks to Black Jack, and Shunsaku sees the murderer board the Marine Express, an underwater train built by the knowledgeable Professor Narzenkopf (played by Dr. Ochanomizu from the Tetsuwan Atom series), who also boards the train with his son Atom. From there, it's an investigative action/mystery movie.  
 
The art and animation are probably one of the best from Tezuka, well, being the 70's. I highly enjoyed this movie, though it DID seem to drag out a bit, I hope that's not too big a deal.

","It really is not very good and it's so generic and bland it's crazy. 
 
The only reason I watched it is because I am watching every anime that Gainax has made, and this is one of them, and probably one of their worst works. On a side note, the animation quality and artwork isn't even that bad, too bad they do nothing with that and keep it really boring. 
 
Honestly the only parts I enjoyed was when Akiyuki Shinbo, director Madoka Magica and Monogatari, showed off his signature style where he uses weird framing and composition as well as a unique color palette but those parts were really short and rare.

          
 
       Helpful When you think of great character design and artwork two of the studios you might think of almost immediately are Gainax and Studio 4∼C.  So it＊s a bit amazing to me that artistically, Debutante Detective Corps turned out to be one of the most horrible looking turds I have seen to date.  I guess even the best have to start somewhere. 
 
Given Debutante's title I am not sure what I was expecting, but regardless of what it was I certainly didn＊t get it.  Nothing about the story or the title make a lot of sense.  Obviously this was a title given by the English dubbing studio and it＊s really only the beginning of this epic fail abortion of an anime.   
 
Our story starts with our five heroines entering the scene in spastic, silly, and unnecessarily flashy manners.  We are given brief bios of the quintet and you better read it because that＊s all the character ""development"" and background story you＊re going to get on any of them.  They are all fabulously wealthy girls and apparently are being threatened by a mysterious organization.  So of course the police, instead of taking our spoiled bitches to some place secure like um, the police station maybe, they take them to a completely unsecure high school where they end up just locking them up in the principal＊s office.  Of course despite the school being blanketed but literally hundreds of armed officers in riot gear our three villains do manage to get inside the school where predictable, over the top, silly, and retarded action ensues. 
 
Nothing about the story works.  The comedy doesn＊t because it relies mainly on having some sort of emotional investment in the characters.  Given the shortness of the OVA this is practically an impossible task.  Once the revelation is made at the end as too who is behind the attack, you＊re likely to either explode into a howling laughter at its stupidity or face palm.  Or perhaps both.  Obviously that this was meant as a pilot episode for a potential series.  It＊s not shocking at all that this was never picked up.  At least someone with some sense and good judgment realized how god awful the concept was and thus the world was saved from the potential of a full season of this garbage. 
 
The characters are standard 90s clich谷s.  You have every kind of ""action"" girl in the cast.  The Chinese martial arts master, the Russian big guns girl, the explosives expert, the master of disguise, and the psychic master of magic＊s.  In addition we are treated to the usual tsundere, moe, and bratty personality types displayed in every other anime ever made.  There is nothing extraordinary or memorable about any of them and honestly you will have a tough time just remembering their names let alone anything about them.  The villains and supporting characters are equally stale and stupid. 
 
Artistically this is about as bad as I have ever seen.  The style is typical of the era of which I am not a fan of at all but even for the 90s this is epically horrible work.  It＊s really shocking to me too when you consider the studios involved in its production.  For me it＊s really difficult to imagine how anyone ever thought this looked good.  The sound and music score are as drab and uninteresting as the animation.  The lack of a decent story makes it impossible for any talent level of seiyuu to give a good performance. 
 
If you＊re considering watching this because of the studios involved in its production like I did, don＊t.  You will be disappointed.  Debutante Detective Corps is best left to the dustbin of history.  I am sure those who made it would also wish you forget it exists too.

Amidst a violent urban background with cyber-junkies creating chaos around the city, this other 8 Man will fight criminals in a more agressive way. ","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama']","Detective Yokoda is murdered by criminals and his body is retrieved by Professor Tani. Tani takes the body to his laboratory where he attempts to transfer Yokoda's life force into an android body, an experiment that has already failed seven times. Yokoda is reborn as the armour-skinned android 8 Man and is able to dash at impossible speeds as well as shape-shift into other people. He takes on his former body, this time taking on the name ""Hachiro Azuma."" He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss, Chief Tanaka. Even his girlfriend Sachiko and his friend Ichiro are not aware that he is an android. As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime每eventually avenging his own murder. To rejuvenate his powers, he smokes ""energy"" cigarettes that he carries in a case on his belt.In Japan, the character's origin varies significantly between the original manga, the TV series, and the live-action movie. In the original Japanese manga and TV series, the character's name does not change when he is reborn as 8 Man. The ""Detective Yokoda"" name was created for the live-action version. In the manga, Detective Azuma is trapped in a warehouse and gunned down, while the TV series has him killed when he is run over by a car. In contrast, the original Japanese version had the main character named as ""8 Man"", as he is considered an extra member of the Japanese police force. There are seven regular police precincts and 8 Man is treated as an unofficial eighth precinct.
The Japanese manga was presented as serial novella stories along with a set of one-shot stories. Many of these stories were edited down and adapted for the TV series. The novella stories were originally printed every week in Shukuu Sh身nen Magazine in 16-page increments that consisted of 15 story pages and one title page. Ten additional one-shot stories were presented in seasonal and holiday specials of Shuukuu Sh身nen Magazine. These stories were generally between 30 and 40 pages in length.
In the North American version of the series, the resurrected detective/android is known as ""Tobor"" or the word ""robot"" spelled backwards. Tani is referred to as ""Professor Genius"" and the sobriquet of 8-Man is slightly changed to ""8th-Man,"" the name explained as he is the 8th attempt to be a super-robot. The story content was directed toward a wider audience of both young and adult viewers. As such, much of the violence was toned down for Western audiences. Due to changes in cigarette advertising laws in the 1960s, television characters were not allowed to be seen smoking. As this was a major plot device in the series, the show was forced to be removed from broadcast in the United States.
","I love this anime i watched a long time ago when i was younger i believe on sci fi then i bought it when i was like 12 lol. it's a good movie unfortionatly I could never get my hands on the tv series or comic books it's very rare that you will come across them but if you ever do don't let go of them O_O 
the anime is great and so is the music it feels so unbelievably 80s that i love it japanese and english its pretty good.If your into cops,cyborgs,and crime animes you should definatly check this out ! 
^.^ 


          
 
       Helpful Gotham city has Batman,Metropolis has Superman and the people of New York  has Spiderman.Well  8 Man is the hero in this town.To be honest I didn't really expect much from this anime given its unusual name,8 Man sounds like a name given because all other cool superhero names were taken.Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised and treated to a exciting, well written story. 
 
Hazama Itsuru is a small time detective who runs Hazama Investigations.He""s hired to investigate the disappearance of Eddie Schmidt a top researcher who worked for Biotecho Corp and to uncover the mystery behind a cyborg parts theft.His job gets even more difficult because after hes almost killed by an old foe,professor Tani the same individual that hired him is force to safe his life by turning him into a super cyborg known as the 8 man.    
 
Hazama struggles to come to grips with his new ordeal but at the same time must uncover the corruption behind renegade cyborg criminal flooding the city streets and the political corruption behind it all. 
 
I really like how the story develops,each characters is well done with a strong purpose and quite realistic  with most having some sort of backstory to avoid them feeling out of place.I really like the animation the drawing is well done with fairly rich detail and colour.There wasn't a great deal of music in this one but I did like the closing theme.The action is fast paced and intense with typical 90s anime gore.Overall  a enjoyable watch.

          
 
       Helpful yooooo...I enjoyed this anime having watched it for the first time today it did not disappoint. so i dig it very much. i loved every aspect of the anime narrative story, and the name given to the ultimate super hero '8 man' like a man who never dies or if he does he comes back to life (8=infinity yeah? whatever lol)  
 
The soundtrack to this anime was part of the reason it kept me wanting to watch it   as you may know the story ends with the inevitable,  all action super hero live and win, by destroying the enemies in the city town, the catch is that sometimes it will make you question wether that isn't the case for once. what if this time round, a superhero leaves and never comes back after suffering a   violent death? but hey what do you think or do?, well...you turn to technology and make man a machine to fully operate and functioned for military purposes and local police duties. thats the story. :)

(Source: RightStuf)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Space']","In Slayers, it was mentioned that the main characters of that series live on a world that is one of the four created by the mother of all creation, called the Lord of Nightmares. This world was known as the Red World. Lost Universe, however, takes place in a different world, known as the Black World. Whereas the demi gods of the various worlds, such as Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo and Dark Star Dugradigdo had physical presence in that world, they appear in the Black World as ""Lost Ships"", intelligent space ships of unknown origin that have powerful or somewhat divine powers with more advanced technology than any other device in the universe. 
Their rarity and superiority has sparked suggestions that they have been made by an advanced ancient alien civilization or by coming from the beginning of the universe itself. Being a central part to the plot the ""Lost Ships"" are intelligent beings with different loyalties and even their own agenda. Kane Blueriver, a ""trouble contractor,"" inherits a ""Lost Ship"" from his grandmother and from there, he and his sidekick Milly, together with Canal, the ship's computer, journey to find a source of the evil that threatens the universe.
","Lost Universe is an OK anime. Only OK. It's tries to be funny but comes off more annoying that funny. There are times when it's actually funny but the overdose of sarcasm and cheesy tongue-in-cheek dialog mixed in with the [deliberately] bad acting makes it all seem like the writers and/or voice actors didn't take the show too seriously. Lost Universe is along the same lines as Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop [but nowhere near as cool or bad-ass!] It's about a small group of bounty hunters aka ※trouble shooters§ who fly around deep space doing odd jobs in order to get paid. 
 
~ Art/Animation 
Average 90s style art. All the people had pointy cheeks, pointy chins and large geometric, pointy eyes with crazy hair of varying colors and shapes. There is some nice CG work in this series but it may be before CG became really popular and common for everyday TV series, so overall the show just kind of had that very flat old-school look. 
 
~ Sound 
Um, it's not the most splendid music in the world, This anime made me realize something....that at some point anime music has become a stand-alone product. Modern anime music is now good enough to market itself as a viable product which you can buy as a CD or MP3 and listen to on the [INTERNET] radio. The music on Lost Universe is not this type of music, it's strictly on that cartoony level and it doesn't ever go beyond that. The English voice actors were a trip [or maybe just tripping!] I don't know if they were being that bad on purpose or not! If the show was a bit older I'd say they were genuinely bad...if it were a newer series then they were definitely being cynical. This show seems to be a bit of both, CRIKEY!!! 
 
~ Story 
I believe this is the first anime I've ever watched that seems to fall into the ※parody§ category because it's clearly poking fun at the Space Adventure / Sci-fi genre [shall I count how many Star Wars inferences there were?] Like I said earlier, Lost Universe is about a small group of wannabe bounty hunters who go sailing though outer space taking all of these low-paying, high-risk jobs they can manage just so that they can put food on the table and buy ridiculous weapons. There does seem to be a bigger plot wherein there is some sinister organization with evil spaceships and such lurking in the shadows trying to foul up everything for Kain and his ditsy crew-members. But alas, with all the campy voice acting going on, the show quickly becomes oh-so-very annoying as it progresses with it eventually losing focus [along with the viwer's attention] and finally ending with the central plot falling off to the wayside. They say ""too much of a good thing can harm ya..."" well in this case, it's the cheesy-ass humor. 
 
~ Cast/Characters 
And the best character award goes to: Kali, the creepy Faux ※English§ woman walking around smashing up stuff with her whip. She has got to be the looniest assassin in all of anime-world. First of all she's got this wacky and somewhat slurred British accent, WTF dude, like seriously lay off the brandy and peppermint schnapps BEFORE you go to work, hon. And if that didn't make her already deranged enough then there's the fact that she walks around town with that whip trying to kill people, like really....just use a gun, lady!  Then there's wannabe that Luke Skywalker, Kain Blueriver, complete with fake light-saber and dorky cape. He's not bad to look at but he's no hunk either...he gets a 5 on the Bishounen Hunter scale. Rail on the other hand gets a 7 because he's dark, a brunette and suave...except when gets a face full of coffee because of his clumsy-ass, lovesick assistant. The two main dingbats that make up Kain's crew are an even mix of funny and annoying, most of the time they sound like Edith Bunker's younger sisters...what total airheads! Even though the green-haired one is supposed to be a computer she's still an airhead! 
 
~ Is it worth it? 
No, not really. it's not that it's a bad story, but the voice actors went a little overboard with the ad-libbing and cheesy lines....this may have worked with Ghost Stories [which is like, some underground anime cult hit now or something.] But that type of humor overwhelms this show and before long you stop rolling on the floor with laughter and start rolling your eyes. This is only You-Tube or CrunchRoll worthy.

          
 
       Helpful I picked this up after seeing the original Japanese intro several years ago and gave this a shot.  Like most people, I saw this after seeing Slayers, Next, and Try. 
 
This actually does take place in a similar (if not the same) universe as Slayers, with most of the voice cast also being the same.  Not surprisingly, a lot of the humor style was the same but there was a lot more emphasis on an underlying story which is emphasized more later.  It reminded me a bit of a Slayers Next style where bits and pieces are planted here and there while hijicks run awry...at least until near the end.  One thing Lost Universe does better than Slayers though is it shows more sides to the characters. 
 
The main characters are pretty well rounded out, except Millie but most of what you need to know happens later anyway.  You start feeling for some of the characters though, and by the end of the series I starting getting kind of attached to some of the characters.  The antagonists on the other hand range from dull to pretty messed up. 
 
One big determining factor of how much a series impacts me is the ending.  Lost Universe does a great job cleaning up all the loose ends and making the story and characters make sense.  The ending is very bittersweet, while leaves questions, they're not ones that you need answers to.  It's nice to see series that doesn't make you wonder if there might be a sequel or not. 
 
What bugs me if anything is the art.  The art is pretty rough, similar to Slayers but sometimes felt inconsistent.  Sometimes I can't tell if there's more Yashigani than just ep. 4.  I might just be bothered by the way the eyes are drawn.  Of course, the CG sequences are dated, but can't be helped. 
 
Another annoying factor is the voice acting, particularly for Kain.  He sounds like a choked chicken and at times it gets grating to the ears, especially how many times he yells throughout the series. 
 
Little nitpicks aside, I very much enjoyed the series.  Check it out especially if you've seen and enjoyed Slayers Next and Try.

          
 
       Helpful If you're expecting this series to be on par with The Slayers... it's not. 
 
This anime is a revenge story with Kane Blueriver a swordsman who wishes to kill his enemies. However like The Slayers it tends to shift between serious & comical scenes, yet the comedy in Lost Universe was a personal flop to me. Most of this is due to the lack of likeable characters & the smaller roster compared to Slayers. In this series we only have 3 protagonists who aren't that interesting. Kane passes of as the would be son of Lina & Gourry but for the most has this running gag of being obsessed with his cape.  Milly Nocturne has the egotistical nature of Lina but none of the charm. Lastly there's Canal Vorfeed who just comes off as supportive & energetic but doesn't offer much. 
 
Lost Universe is simply too long to tell its story with events being delivered slowly with cheap gags, poor action & boring characters. As a fan of The Slayers, I expected too much from this series. The anime does deliver some interesting sci-fi but could explored better in other animes. There are also some references to Slayers Try but isn't really noticeable (its the lost ships names).  
 
Overall the anime is a very poorly made version of The Slayers. I'm a fan of English, Spanish & Japanese dubs but the English version took A LOT of liberties with its dialogue giving itself a dub that's so bad that it might be good. I would recommend watching The Slayers, Cromartie High School, Binbogami Ga & Gintama for great comedy anime.

(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Super Power', 'Seinen']",none,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS. 
 
 
SUMMARY: Goku Midnight Eye 2 starts out just as goofy and fun as the first part, but devolves into a way more grim and frankly unpleasant watch that was not my cup of tea. If you like 80s style anime gore without a deep story or characters, and just like the action as animated by Madhouse, this is the OVA for you. If you want something in the vein of the fun and goofy action from the first OVA, you will be very disappointed, as this one contains way less (unintentional?) comedy and way more questionable drama. 
 
 
Goku Midnight Eye 2 starts off with what's basically a ""cold open"", a sequence completely unrelated to the main story. Here, we get a stakeout in an exclusive rooftop club, and soon enough a hilarious chase sequence ensues where our protagonist and the sleazebag mafia man he's after slide around on rooftops. It's directly in the tone of the previous movie, and I really like it. 
 
However, if you are like me and you came for the 80s OVA goofiness, then you should seriously stop watching after this sequence and just pretend it was a short. What follows is a main story that really wasn't what I expected or hoped for, and ended up being a serious buzzkill. As so often, your mileage may vary, but in my opinion Part 2 of Goku Midnight Eye isn't nearly as enjoyable as Part 1. 
 
Part 2's tone quickly shifts to a far more grim and dark one. While Part 1 had a good balance in my opinion to keep things fun, Part 2 goes for a proper overtuned noir story with more gore, a darker backstory and more graphic violence against women in particular. The plotline follows a woman asking Goku's help to save her brother, who turns out to have been subjected to intense brainwashing and medical experiments. He's a complete killer machine, and the amount of gore and violence has gone up as a result. Later on, a prostitute is basically raped to death. 'Nuff said. 
 
The movie's animation has also changed as a result - We see way less of the colorful, moody Cyberpunk aesthetic and more drab backgrounds and colors. The action is toned down in its fun romp-like quality and gets way more serious and gorey. The plot is still nonsense, but instead of being made to enable a goofy, fun time like the first OVA, it feels more as a very basic setup to excuse more brutal scenes. Absolutely not my cup of tea. I don't need every story to be deep, but gore for the sake of gore is not for me. 
 
 
 
BOTTOM LINE: I personally cannot recommend this part of Goku Midnight Eye. The dreary art, the way harsher tone and the excess of violence and gore for the sake of it really didn't do it for me. I found some of the scenes outright appalling. The story makes no well executed attempts to justify its brutality - It feels like a proper exploitation movie, and that's not my thing. 
 
 
CONTENT WARNINGS: Plenty of gore, brainwashing and medical torture, explicit portrayals of rape and murder, more sexism than the first OVA too. 


          
 
       Helpful The 1st time i saw midnight eye part 1 and 2 was back in 1997,98 via an rental videotape i never brought back, i was from that point on a keeper! I did a review of part 1, part 2 goes further in the story, wich goes more in to an emotional side since a fine lady is involved. Animation just as good as part 1, nice background sketche?s, futuristic but less important chara. and no involvement in police depart. anymore sadly. It still has some good late 80?s tracks to keep up, and WAY more violent scenes for a cyberpunk cultclassic compared to part 1, less mysterious `happenings` is involved but thats up for u to decide!

 now to be completely honest if i was 8 years younger and still have the maturity and attention span of a gerbil then i probably would've enjoyed this anime 
now if you dont heed my warning and pursue to watch this regardless of what this random person on internet is saying... well then keep keyboard mouse glasses at a distance to avoid unconsciously throwing them also move yourself back 2 feet from desk to avoid slamming your head on the desk...

I do like this anime,I found it really intriguing at times.There was always this sense of mystery to the episodes,while still being funny and charming in in it's own unique way.It's definatly not for everyone, it does lose a bit of that mystery element as it goes on and drags itself out for 26 episodes,but dont take it from me.It's certanly a good series to watch just for a laugh and for quirky characters and story lines (as cheesy as they can get)

Instead we get a slapping together of mediocrity with little to no relation to the original material. Everything is mediocre at best, laughable and pathetic at worse. 
 
That being said I love this anime, as it is one of my firsts. It does have a certain charm to it if you can look past how lazy it is. It takes so many shortcuts and just does not seem to care, and that makes it enjoyable in an ironic sort of way.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Police', 'Vampire', 'Fantasy']",none,"First, quick disclaimer: I dropped the show after 6 episodes, so maybe it improves afterwards (don?t think so). Oh, and very mild spoilers on some action scenes ahead (no spoilers on the story, though). 
 
Special 7 depicts a Shadowrun-esque world, similar to Copcraft, but one where magic use is very restricted and really powerful. It follows the adventures of an elite police unit that for reasons unknown operates independently from, and it?s despised by the rest of the police force. 
 
It loosely follows the GitS template so we have the usual array of members. We have the MC (or more like audience surrogate), a normal human and rookie detective, that joined the force because of [tragic childhood event]. Then there?s a small girl from some magical race I don?t remember who is a hacker and drone operator, and whose only character trait seems be to repeating  'I?m a ninja!' ad nauseam. The real ninja is a vampire gal, who looks cool but doesn't?t say much. Then the mandatory elite sniper with an eye-patch. And as driver we have a snotty elf with a grudge. Oh, and the mysterious boss too. The most interesting character is Ichinose, senior detective who cannot hit the broad side of a barn (except when plot demands it) but is apparently a tactical and analysis mastermind (although his plans are basically charge the enemy head-on). 
 
So.. not top notch but not too bad, right? And is some aspects it is not. The characters are really one-dimensional but that?s not a cardinal sin if the story and action are OK. And the story, though bland and very predictable, kinda keeps the interest. But oh man the action sucks soooo much it utterly destroys the show. 
 
Basically, the action is A-Team level of stupid. Blow a van with explosives? No problem, the passengers just walk out if it unscathed and ready to be cuffed. Shootout against 30 terrorists holding hostages? No issues, our team is able to shoot the guns out each and every terrorist hands! But the vampire has a sword, right? Worry not! She hits everyone with the flat side!  
 
Now, I?m not a fan of gore, and I don?t need all my shows to be R-rated. But the action is so ridiculous it breaks all suspension of disbelief. Also, it?s not consistent. The snotty elf blows the head off 4-5 bad guys (in a fade-to-black, sure, but they?re gone for good). And then he gets shot in the gut. And there?s blood. And the bad guys kill people too. Off-screen mostly but they do and we even see pools of blood.  
 
So why sometimes we have deaths and the rest of the time is A-Team level of nonsense? Go figure. 
 
To summarize: Not great, not terrible. If the above does not bother you and you dig the 'orcs, elfs and magic in today?s world' setting, then give it a chance.

I would recommend this anime as a 'palate cleanser' anime (by that I simply mean a quick 1-season 12 episode anime to watch while in between 2 really good shows, for example I watch slice of life shows in-between shows such as Demon Slayer and Fire Force).

STORY: 5/10 at best tbh,  
pretty slow and generic, I watched it weekly alongside Ahiru no Sora and BNHA S4 so I didn't retain much info between episodes. 
 
ANIMATION: 8/10 
Personally I love this style of animation so I thoroughly enjoyed that. It gave me some madhouse anime vibes which I also loved.  
 
CHARACTERS/ VOICES: 9/10 
9/10 Mainly because I loved the voice acting, Tsuda Kenjirou as a protag is quite rare for me ?? but other than that Hiro Shimono, Suzuki Tatsuhisa etc. were all a really good combination. 
BUT in terms of characters themselves its probably a 6.5, I liked all the characters, mostly Ichinose since he gave me Shinya vibes, but overall the characters were pretty generic.

       Helpful After watching an important number of Gordon Ramsay's famous show called ""Kitchen Nightmares"", a few words dug their place in my memory : bland, dreadful, disgusting. 
 
Well Keishichou Tokumubu Tokushu Kyouakuhan Taisakushitsu Dainanaka: Tokunana was bland & blank by its universe, dreadful by its abnormaly long title which I never dared to pronounce and... not disgusting, this one is just a bonus. Contains minor spoilers. 
 
Let's get straight to the point which I disliked the most : the universe and its logic. A modern world where different species such as vampires, ""homonculus girl with blonde hair"", dwarves and any type of magic users live in harmony. Found this part attractive ? Hell forget about it because the main plot is centralized around a serie of terrorists attacks who eventually had the resurrection of the dragons who disappeared from Earth. And no, all these terrorist attacks and all the cases seen during the 12 episodes barely involved magic, like a very tiny bit of magic. Quite disappointing for a universe which includes a lot magic users. 
 
Now what is the biggest disappointment for me, is the absolute lack of originality for the 7 main characters. If 2 are humans, the rest are non-humans which looks interesting on the paper, at least it caught my interest. However this show could have 7 perfectly human characters, it would be exactly the same : what's the point then to build a unit made of ""on the paper"" complementary members ? 
 
Great question I couldn't answer after 13 weeks, including the very useless recap  (how ironic that all the greatest 24-episodes animes this year, such as Dr. Stone, Vinland Saga and Kimetsu no Yaiba didn't EVEN have a single recap/week break...). The characters are absolutely non-interesting and we hardly learn anything about themselves besides the real MC and his partner/superior who are... humans. The dwarf is a basic sniper eye-patched man, the vampire is basic katana warrior, the ""blond imp"" is just a electronic master, the sort of elf is just a basic detective with long ears and their boss is purely an old magic user who stopped using magic (a regular human ? Kinda)? 
 
If we swap to the other side, aka the villain side : is it any better ? Oh god no, there are only 2 villains who don't get any interesting afterall. Classic thema of ""wannabe master of the world so let's start a ritual to proceed"". Their whole plan is absolutely boring and instead of giving any sort of emotions (horror for example, especially with a terrorism thematic), it just gives yourself a dose of anesthetic. 
 
Is there any positive point left ? Well I didn't drop it so that means it is not horrible enough. Actually I desire every Sunday that the weekly episode would eventually bring life to this universe, I wished it would explain me how come non-humans and humans can coexist and what the hell is the goal of this special unit. I first thought this was a unit made to deal with magic users but the only enemies faced were low-skilled/amateurs terrorists with MP5 and a video-game intelligence (no, that's not a compliment). Only a few moments just reminded me it was a magical/supernatural show and not your average police show. 
 
So to summarize my global opinion : disappointing, the universe itself fails to  have its own identity and I could only see a blank green background where a bunch of non-natural things were thrown to appetize. Honestly the mix of police thema with supernatural can be interesting, at least I appreciated something a bit similar : Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin which succeeded to give consistancy and life to its universe. Actionless globally (unlike this show I wrote about) but much more captivant and interesting. Talking about action, Keishichou[...] was not a catastrophe with its decent fights but they were nothing but lifeline instead of a strong point.

16,2076,59,5.445362311,Detective and his or her helper,Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo,"Hajime Kindaichi's unorganized appearance and lax nature may give the impression of an average high school student, but a book should never be judged by its cover. Hajime is the grandson of the man who was once Japan's greatest detective, and he is also a remarkable sleuth himself. 
 
With the help of his best friend, Miyuki Nanase, and the peculiar inspector Isamu Kenmochi, Hajime travels to remote islands, ominous towns, abysmal seas, and other hostile environments. His life's mission is to uncover the truth behind some of the most cunning, grueling, and disturbing mysteries the world has ever faced. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Shounen']",none,"I am horrified to find out that no one have tried to write a review for this anime. As far as mystery type of genre animes goes, Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo is definitely at the top. Even though this series have been frequently compared with Detective Conan, it was never as popular as Detective Conan because of its slightly milder themes. However, I am not here to debate on which is better, Conan or Kindaichi since Conan is longer running and will have a larger fanbase and better art. If you are an avid fan of the mystery genre, then read on. 
 
  Kindaichi Hajime is a genius with an IQ of 180, despite his sloppy attitude. Just like many other detective animes, he is apparently cursed to end up at the exact places at the exact time when horrifying murder cases occurs. Each case usually lasts 3-4 episodes, usually ending with the murderer repenting and reminiscing about the painful past that leads to the motive. Although the pattern becomes clear to the viewers very soon, it never gets old. Just when you thought that it is another same old case where they get trapped in a confined area, the show throws in an unexpected case such as the Kidnapping Case of Hayami Reika. It follows very closely to the manga, even though not all cases are present in the anime.  
 
  What is splendid about this anime is that it invites the viewers to try and solve the mystery before the last episode that will reveal all. The show makes sure that the viewer gets all the clues possible before revealing the culprit in question.This makes for a pleasant experience for the viewers and they won't feel left out of the anime. This also allows the viewers to root for Kindaichi because he will always reveal the answer to the mystery. It is always awesome to hear Kindaichi announce: ""All the mysteries have been solved!"" Commence anime swooning. 
 
  As far as the art goes, it is not incredible in anyway, and for a anime made in 1997, there shouldn't be much expectation to match animes of nowadays. I have no complains either way as it does not affect the experience and the creepy cases still gets to me all the same. The terrible scenes of  the bodies being found never cease to instill fear in me. It does not matter if they were hanged, drowned or stabbed. It is always horrifying, despite the art being behind times. 
 
  The sound can get quite repetive, with the same music playing in the background when: someone screams, chase scene, rushing to another area, corpse found and when they realise something horrible. This cannot really be avoided since Kindaichi is made up of several cases. The incredible openings of each season easily make up for these few flaws. I cannot imagine anyone skipping past the first opening Confused Memories or Kimi Ga Iru Kara... simply because the music just suits the theme of Kindaichi so well. It is a perfect start to a new mystery or case as things gets more and more intense or bloody. 
 
  As far as characters goes, I absolutely love the main characters. There's Kindaichi with his humorous 'FAILS' with Miyuki to fix and reprimand him for. The police inspector Kenmochi proves to be slightly useful by providing information and using his authority to Kindaichi's whims. Then there's the rivalry between Akechi and Kindaichi, as well as some famous villians that never gets caught. It is  always a fascinating experience to be first spooked by the murders, then to laugh at some of Kindaichi's aloof jokes later on. Thankfully, there's 148 episodes worth of enjoyment. 
 
  If you can't tell by now, I really enjoyed Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo. I still continue to read the new stand-alone manga releases and will always be hungry for more. Hence, if you enjoyed Conan, please try out Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo for a similiar experience that is  slightly different. Personally, I think that both animes stand out in their own ways but Kindaichi is a little less annoying. It's true, having little kids solve mystery gets to me. Personally I find Kindaichi more realistic. But enough of that. If you enjoy a good mystery with complex and ingenious methods involved, you must definitely check this one out. There have got to be more Kindaichi fans.

       Helpful Legit one of the best animes I have ever watched. Kindaichi is unknown in the USA, but I found out about it in a DS game with Conan and this anime is awesome. I'm so glad I decided to watch it. The show is funny and entertaining. The plot develops in ways you don't expect sometimes and the music is also great. The stories are not repetitive which is nice since it would be easy for a show like this to get stale. To me it's sort of like a Japanese Scooby-Doo with murders added. If murder mysteries are your forte - you'll love this show.

God's power is scattered across the Earth, and if He does not gather enough by the turn of the millennium, He will die. To block Him, The Devil had sent out agents to gather His power, which is the beauty in human hearts, in the form of chess pieces. With Finn's assistance, Maron transforms into the reincarnation of Jeanne D'Arc in order to hunt Demons hidden within works of art. When Maron seals a Demon, the artwork disappears, and to the outside world it is as if she has stolen it, and she becomes a kait身 (""phantom thief""). Maron's best friend is Miyako, the daughter of a police detective in charge of Jeanne's case.
As the series progresses, Maron and Miyako fall in love with new classmate Chiaki, who wants to stop Maron collecting the chess pieces, for he knew that Finn Fish is the Da-Tenshi (Fallen Angel), but apparently in the form of normal angel. Chiaki at first ""fakes"" falling in love to get closer to Maron, knowing Maron is Jeanne. Later he falls in love truthfully after realising that Maron is worth the effort, even if she does ""hate"" him. Maron, on the other hand, is confused and does not know what ""love"" means because her parents abandoned her when she was around ten years old when they were having problems getting along, so no one taught her. As a result, she does not know how to respond to Chiaki's advances.
The manga relates in detail Finn Fish's background, expounding on Finn's relationships with other angels and the events that led to her becoming Maron's partner. This backstory of the angels is not shown in the anime. Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne has often drawn comparisons to Sailor Moon for the magical girl theme and similarity in appearance between Kaitou Jeanne and Sailor Moon.
","So this anime is great, i love the romance, i love the magic, i love the characters. 
 
story : 8/10 
 
i said i love this anime, but this anime is really stressed on what is absolute evil and what is absolute kindness, im kinda against that so i personally think this is an anime for younger kids and would like u to know that the plot is great its just my personal issues. There are good points and bad points to both the anime and manga, i recommend watching both. The manga have a better ending, though the anime already have a happy ending(i meant it you are not new to anime you pretty much know all this kinds of anime leads to happy ending) but the manga ending is like even more happy or something? 
If you watch both, you will get a very detailed backstory for each main character.   
 
art : 10/10 
 
the art is PERFECT. it is so shoujo-ish, its exactly for girls. Now i would say that the manga actually have better art than the anime but... the anime' transformation is awesome. so this anime is tittled 'kamikaze kaitou jeanne"", 
and you can kinda guess that it have somethings to do with theives. The main characters actually go through a transformation, which involve flashy lights and lots of turning and stuff. But in the manga its kinda dull, there's not really the process for transformation, like poof the girl has changed. 
 
sound : 9/10 
 
The sound i great, but its like average... there's no really good points and there's no bad points either... 
 
Character : 9/10 
 
the characters are awesome, there's a lot of backstory given for the girl, and a little for the guy. they have strong personality and there's so much of character development. But you know you can never have too much. Now in the manga, there's is more backstory given to fin fish. So it's best to read both manga and anime. 
 
Overall : 8/10 
 
i know it will be 9/10 if i don have a preference over what kinds i like, so it's just something personal.

          
 
       Helpful My first anime. I was so moved. I enjoyed watching my first anime Dearest (as I called them later). As I liked Chiaki I hated Fynn.  
Watching this anime I had fun, but for me, manga was better. Anime isn't so close to manga, and some actions are really bad. Oh, and I hate openings. I always skipped them >.>

          
 
       Helpful I just finished watching this anime for the second time today, and I adore it. I love the plotline, and the characters have great personalities. 
 
The story and progress of the story is a little slow in the beginning, but Maron's past and her slowly evolving bond with Chiaki managed to keep me interested. Of course, her adventures as Kaitou Jeanne and the adorable Fin Fish, as well as the mystery around Kaitou Sinbad and Access rope you in as well. 
 
The second season is when this story really starts to get amazing, in my opinion. You start to learn more about Jeanne d'Arc herself, Maron and Chiaki become closer, and the drama gets more intense as it progresses as you learn more about Maron's parents. Not to mention what you learn about Fin. ;D 
 
I love this anime for many reasons, and if you like Magical Girl animes, this is a must watch for you.

16,780,61,5.406654,Detective and his or her helper,Detective Conan Movie 02: The Fourteenth Target,"A mysterious attacker has appeared and is assaulting people whose names contain a number from the standard deck of cards in descending order. When Conan Edogawa points out that all the victims are related to the now famous detective Kogorou Mouri, suspicion immediately falls upon the recently released convict Jou Murakami, as Kogorou was the one responsible for his arrest ten years prior. 
 
With potential victims still at risk, Conan and the police are determined to catch the culprit. As the case gradually unfolds, both Conan and his friend Ran Mouri learn more about her parents' separation and the truth on what transpired a decade ago. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']","Rachel has a nightmare of her mother Eva being shot and she calls her up to discuss it. After the phone call, Eva begins questioning herself if her daughter is beginning to remember an incident that left a scar on her upper thigh. Across town, J.T. Morono is released from prison and intends to visit Richard. Dr. Agasa takes the Junior Detective League to a museum. While there, they see Emilio Cantour, a famed photographer, snapping pictures. Mitch quizzes the other members but Conan correctly guesses the right answer. At the Moore agency, Morono leaves after receiving no answer.
Rachel and Serena are attending the book signing of essayist Mason Norfolk. They later visit a cafe where Rachel mentions the fight between her parents which resulted in their separation. Back at the agency, Richard is getting ready for dinner with Eva while Conan notices a TV interview with Christopher Aston, the owner of the newly built AquaCrystal, an entertainment complex situated in the middle of the bay.
While meeting Eva at the restaurant, Richard runs into two of his old friends; Henry Tish, a professional golfer who is training for the US Open, and Kevin Simms, a sommelier. The date goes well until Richard noticed Peter Ford, a newscaster, flirting with his friend, Tammy Diez. He gets jealous, causing Eva to leave abruptly.
A week later, Inspector Meguire, Eva, and Agasa are attacked by a mysterious assailant, leaving behind a cardboard western sword, flower, and ornament respectively at the crime scenes. Conan discovers that the items come from the King, Queen, and Jack playing cards, specifically the suit of spade, which represents death, and that the culprit appears to be targeting victims according to their relation to a card in sequential order and share a connection with Richard. When trying to figure out a possible culprit, Richard mentions J.T. Morono, a shady card dealer who he arrested 10 years prior. Inspector Santos tried to shed light on an incident but Meguire sternly insists on preventing the next attack.
While driving, Conan asks about the incident where Santos reveals that after Morono was finished with questioning, he went to the bathroom, overpowered the escorting guard, took his gun, and attempted to escape; Eva, who brought along a young Rachel and taking Richard a change of clothes, was taken hostage. Richard, then a police officer working under Meguire, drew his gun which led to a brief standoff that ended when he shot his gun, hitting Eva in the thigh. This caught Morono off guard and Richard fired a second time, hitting him in the left shoulder. Richard would go on and resign his position rather facing investigation for his actions. Rachel is distraught after learning the truth and distances herself from Richard.
The next day, Conan remembers that Henry is ranked the 10th best golfer in the world and relays the information to Richard, causing them to tighten security when Henry wants to go flying in his helicopter. During the ride, Henry＊s eyes begin to dilate and Conan discovers someone had replaced them with a chemical compound. He swiftly acts and crash lands the helicopter in the Teitan Elementary playground. Everyone makes it out the  helicopter as he explodes, leaving behind card number 10, and Henry is forced to withdraw from the US Open. The investigation team goes to the home of Kevin Simms as he is Number 8 on the list for attending a culinary school with an 8 year program. Kevin explains he has to meet with Christopher Aston about business at his new AquaCrystal resort. Santos realizes that Christopher owns 9 buildings and the team tags along as security.
At AquaCrystal, they meet Nina Oliver, Emilio Cantour, and Peter Ford, however, Christopher is not there. During the monorail ride, they discover that Santos is the youngest of 3 children and their birthdays are spaced three years apart. Emilio has six children, and Peter＊s last name has 4 letters. Rachel cringes that Jimmy could be the ace being that he＊s number one in many things as well as Japan＊s top detective. Once at the restaurant, Nina and Mason get into an argument over Mason＊s food recommendations he wrote in his books. Nina challenges him to a blind taste test, which Mason accepts but fails. Kevin tastes the wine and guesses the correct answer, leaving Mason embarrassed. At Christopher＊s request via a letter, the group visits the wine cellar where Kevin inadvertently springs a crossbow trap, near the weapon, card number 8. Realizing they are in danger, the group decides to leave but discovers Christopher＊s corpse in the fish tank, attached to his body is card number 9.
Richard explains the situation and about T.J. Morono to everyone. Nina, frightened, explains she nearly hit someone riding a motorcycle with her car but sped off without helping the victim. With all emergency exits blocked off with cement, the killer prepares to strike and shuts off the power. Nina, with her nails glowing in the dark, begins to panic and runs right into the killer who stabs her to death. Her body is found along with the 7 of spades and the joker. The juice can Conan had earlier is believed to have been kicked over by the killer as he went after Nina.
Conan investigates Nina＊s murder and notices one of her nails broke from her finger, the wine cork she had is missing, and a palm print made by a right handed person on her back. He remembers Morono dealing with his left hand, thus clearing him of any wrongdoing. He finds the slacks of an individual stained with juice and suspects them to be the killer. Conan finds salt in the kitchen and gives everyone water to drink and is positive who the killer is.
Bombs explode at AquaCrystal, trapping everyone inside temporarily. More bombs go off with the spade numbers 6-2 emerging from the water. Everyone manages to swim to the shore with the exception of Rachel. She is saved by Conan and Richard. Mason is left unconscious from the incident and Kevin volunteers to perform CPR, but Conan, through Richard＊s voice, forces Santos to do it. Richard, obviously confused, is put to sleep and Conan theorizes that the culprit had a chance encounter with Morono then took advantage of the situation and their past history.
The serial killer is revealed to be Kevin Simms. Most of his victims were merely pawns to disguise his real targets: Nina Oliver, Christopher Aston, Mason Norfolk, and Henry Tish. After murdering Christopher, Kevin set up his own trap in the wine cellar. His motive is that he has taste disorder and is unable to taste food or drink due to trauma or stress. Kevin was seen tasting chili powder, something sommeliers shouldn＊t do. He was also given salt water by Conan and didn＊t react to it, thus confirming his suspicions. As evidence, the wine cork Nina painted before her death is found in Kevin＊s possession. When he attacked her, she turned around and slipped it into his coat pocket without his knowledge. Also inside is the Ace of Spades he intended for Jimmy Kudo.
Kevin confesses and reveals that Nina indeed caused the collision that robbed him of his ability to taste. Christopher buys expensive wine but improperly stores them, a move he finds offensive. Mason poses as a writing expert on fine wine and cuisine, but lacks proper knowledge on the topic. A drunken Henry invited Kevin to a party then belittled him. He came up with the plan after meeting Morono who wanted to apologize for the past incident. Morono was brought over to Kevin＊s house and was in fact murdered before the beginning of Kevin＊s killing spree. He intended for Mason, his last primary target, to drown below in the sunken restaurant.
Kevin detonates bombs in causing AquaCrystal to slowly sink into the sea and takes Rachel hostage; the investigation team giving chase. AquaCrystal begins crumbling and Kevin intends to escape via helicopter. They confront him at the top of the complex where Santos prepares to shoot but forfeits his gun. When Kevin orders Conan to give him the weapon, Conan finally realizes the truth behind the shooting incident between Richard and Eva. He shoots the gun and the bullet grazes Rachel, leaving Kevin hopeless and without a hostage. Richard charges for Kevin and delivers a powerful Judo throw that slams the serial killer to the ground. Kevin slips over the ledge wanting to die in the sea but Richard saves him, intending for him to answer for his crimes in a federal prison for the rest of his life. They save Rachel, who also understands Richard's actions during her mother's hostage incident; the bullet was intended for Eva so Morono would have no use for a wounded hostage. She clutches onto Richard and they escape from AquaCrystal as it finally collapses into the sea while the others are saved by the coast guard. Kevin is arrested.
Sometime later, after the end credits, Eva reveals the real reason she left Richard. After her hostage incident, she made dinner for Richard as thanks. He instead insulted the food, enraging Eva and ultimately causing the separation due to him being ungrateful. Conan and Rachel both agree that Eva＊s cooking isn＊t the best as the film officially ends.
","hi i think i decided to review all of detective movie after rewatching it. let's get on to the review 
 
Story: 7 
 
this time the story is about attempt at serial killing of 13 people that are related to kogoro mouri. the build up is pretty good although a bit draggy in the beginning but an improvement compared to the first movie 
 
Art: 7 
 
pretty fluid in movement there is no really major improvement when compared to the first movie overall pretty fitting for a movie 
 
Sound: 6 
 
yeah.. the standard detective conan music. if you like the music from the tv series you bound to like this one too 
 
Character: 6 
 
thankfully there is more character on this one. frankly its way too eazy to guess the culprit in the first because of how there is only a few character in there, the second have more character and more diverse personalities oh and the character from tv series is coming back. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
as usual detective conan is an enjoyable movie if you have nothing to do at home 
 
Overall: 7 
 
if you are itching for some detective mystery series then go ahead and watch this one

          
 
       Helpful SPOILER ALERT 
 
A brilliant story, and the system which the murderer uses in amazing, the story itself is good then too, and the plot isn't what you think it is. A cool story, with a second story in it, a piece of Mouri and Ran's past, I gained alot of respect for Mouri through this (and the first) movie. I see this character in a (almost) new light. 
 
Same ol' characters, just as usual good, we get a look at a piece of Mouri's and Ran past, which made me see Mouri in a new light, a better light, the new introduced characters, the old villian, the victims and the murderer are great, all are different, yet the same in a way, and without knowing it (most of them) bear a relationship with each other. Magnificent! 
 
It all begins with Ran having a nightmare, where her father shoots her mother. This actually happened, he only grazed her. Now, 10 years later, Ran tries to find out, why did he shoot the kidnapper, if he knows, he could've killed his own wife? This is the sidestory for this movie. 
 
The real story is how a murderer takes out (or tries to take out) 13 people which are related to Det.Mouri, by playing a smart death-system via cards and numbers. As soon as injuries become murders, our... police team, Mouri and Conan get angered and try to find out who the murderer is, and why he's doing it. It all folds together in the end, with most of the (chosen) victims in one place, this is where the mainplot folds out. At the ending of the movie itself, the reasoning from the past (where Mouri shot his wife) comes to place, when it's happening again, (this time of course with Ran and Conan). 
 
The art's good, so is the animation, sometimes the animation is really smooth and lovely, sometimes it's just normal animation. But they did a good job.

          
 
       Helpful Story - 7 
A good premise with a lot of mystery and tension. Unfortunately there are way too many chunks of slow pacing, coupled with awkward expositions, that made the movie feel like it was dragging for time. Personally I disliked the lack of viewer involvement in solving this case, especially since the action part failed to fill the void. 
 
Art - 5 
Definitely higher in quality compared to the TV series, but a noticeable drop from the previous movie and at times unfaithful to the style. For example in the chase scenes, Conan starts and stops jarringly with no acceleration or deceleration. Style wise, Inspector Megure is way more expressive to the point it's beyond comical. 
 
Sound - 2 
Definitely the biggest weakness of this movie. With an already poor pacing, the painfully obvious lack of sound other than dialogue made the film feel incredibly empty and dull. There were many occasions where the typical BGM or SE were missing, like ""Conan's theme"" during the chase scene, ""Ran's theme"" during the neutral parts and so on. 
 
Character - 8 
This is the only reason to watch this movie. A great deal of backstory is revealed on Kogoro Mouri and his wife, which also affects Ran. This was the first real time we see Kogoro Mouri in a different light other than comical, and even come to have some respect for him. We also see Ran's main motive in life, bringing her parents back together. 
 
Enjoyment - 6 
Has it's moments, definitely some great comedy here and there. The build up and pay-off is decent. 
 
Overall - 6 
It does still have the Conan charm from the TV series and then some. But it is noticeably lacking in certain areas especially in comparison to the previous movie. Still great to watch for the characters, their history and development.

       Helpful The six part sequel to Bible Black, taking place (by my own estimate) at least six years later.  
 
Bible Black: New Testament retains the majority of characters from Bible Black, the glaring exception being Minase (who's mentioned once, and even then is fate is vague), and introduces an antagonist that's even more sinister than Kitami.

This sequel was slightly a disappointment for me to the strong original series. The quality of the animations is the same like before but the characters were much more uninteresting and kind of unlikeable for me. This series takes place a few years after the first series, so like the schoolgirls are done with school and already have a job. I didn't like Imari at all now, not concerning the later episodes and what she is then, no already from beginning, she was really different than she was a girl and her speech is different as well. 
 
I would like to have seen just all the old characters and how they interact with eachother. the story itself wasn't anything special, it didn't have those interesting aims like in the old series. I must admit that i kind of liked the cold imari later and also some more characters. Some sex scenes were interesting, others just so common. 
 
In this series you will see alot of futanari action, besides that a few male on girls scenes. Besides that there are alot of other fetish you can expect like bondage. For me an OK Hentai itself.

From their rundown and shabby office, they run a humble if not failing private investigation service. The spunky and cute Nanba Teru (who＊s father owns the building when Jo and Takeshi reside in) frequently interferes in their affairs by threatening eviction (Jo is continually months behind in back rent).  
 
Since they rarely get any clients, they must resort to eavesdropping and spying on the Secret International Police Department headquarters, located in the building across from theirs in order to get their assignments. Unbeknownst to Jo and Teru, Takeshi has a deep secret. Not only is Takeshi the son of the International Police Department Chief but in times of peril and danger, mild-mannered Takeshi uses his trusty Poly-Met (Polymer Helmet) to transform into the Superhero ※Hurricane§ Polymer, a red suited masked man with incredible fighting abilities and superhuman strength. The only one who knows Takeshi＊s secret is his lazy Saint Bernard, Daisaku, who always likes to provide cutting commentary to the audience (using his inner voice).  
 
Together Jo and Takeshi (as Polymer) confront and battle a myriad of evil organizations, criminal gangs, mutants and monsters as they fight crime in the future city of Washinkyo (Washington/Tokyo). 
 
(Source: japanhero.com)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Police', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","Onigawara, the director of the International Secret Police Agency, looked forward to making Takeshi a top-notch criminal investigator. Takeshi was given training, which turned him into an all-around sportsman as well as martial arts expert. However, Takeshi's attitude toward crime-fighting was so incompatible with Onigawara's, that he disowned him. For a while Takeshi investigated crime alone; then he became private detective Joe Kuruma's assistant and general handyman under the alias Takeshi Yoroi. Secretly, however, Takeshi obtained from a scientist a new artificial polymer, polymet, that was far stronger than steel. With this polymet Takeshi transformed himself into Hurricane Polymar, a costumed hero that fights for  justice and to defeat various gangs.
","I watched this last year, and I didnt particularly like it, but somehow I can't forget it, so I'll try writing a review. 
 
Most episodes follow the same scheme: The gang hangs around in Kuruma's office and gets knowledge of Interpol's plans, thanks to Takeshi's spying efforts. Then, Takeshi beats up a lot of guys in hilarious animal costumes. 
In a few episodes, Takeshi's backstory is treated, and occasionally, the relation between Takeshi and his father makes some progress. Apart from that, there not much overarching story that I remember. It is mainly animal costume guy of the week hunt. 
I didn't find art and sound remarkable. Sometimes I remember the opening song. 
 
The bad guys and their underlings had distinctive animal costumes. Apart from that, they were rather flat characters who where evil for no apparent reason and had some megalomaniac plans. I found them all dull. 
Takeshi's gang was more fun. I especially liked the great detective Kuruma who always looked for excuses to avoid work and not to pay his rent. His dog was the most intelligent character in the series, but unfortunately, he could not speak. 
 
After some episodes, it got stale, apart from the action between Takeshi's gang members. The bad guy hunt got boring. And - I found the violence displayed more and more disturbing. Not because it was gory, rather because of the casual way violence was performed. Takeshi beats great numbers of animal costume guys to death and does not really seem to give a second thought about it. Somehow, I found this more and more creepy the more I proceded, and it still haunts me. 
For comparison: Right now, I watch Hokuto no Ken. In there, violence is celebrated, and Ken can make an enemy's death quite slow and cruel. But: If Ken is cruel against an enemy, he has decided to be so for a reason. I don't know why, but I find this much less disturbing than the casual killing in Hurricane Polimar. 
 
Didn't like this series myself, but I would recommend to watch, so you can make your own picture.

          
 
       Helpful I really don't understand why no one watches Hurricane Polymar. There's an abundance of subs. What does it take for you people to watch this classic?  
 
I strongly recommend watching the opening in hopes some of you will actually check out Hurricane Polymar. It can be viewed if you search Hurricane Polymar opening on youtube. 
 
For 1974, The animation is extremely sharp and smooth. It's a comedic not so serious anime. A Kid's action superhero fighting show. The fight scenes have good movements, but are not violent. They are in a beat up the bad guy style. 
 
I thought the story was fun. I loved how Polymer was more oriented towards unleashing his techniques rather than stomping the enemy. Polymer as much as a superhero was also a charismatic idol. It had a great happy feel. The synopsis explains everything down to the last point what Polymar is about. 
 
If you're that lazy to just go by my review, then Takeshi can transform into the superhero Hurricane Polymar using his Polymer helmet and kick bad guys' butt. 
 
Characters except the bad guys are all comedic, good folks. They are humorous not so serious like the anime. It's not a comedy anime, but their antics were cute. Well even the bad guys were funny. They were really funny looking and silly. 
 
 I've really really really enjoyed this super old school anime.  
 
Watch it guys. Please do. I beg you.

However, one night, Angou disappears. A photograph taken at the bar is all that is left of the three together. 
 
Fast forward to the present, and Dazai is now a member of the Armed Detective Agency. The Guild, an American gifted organization, has entered the fray and is intent on taking the Agency's work permit. They must now divide their attention between the two groups, the Guild and the Port Mafia, who oppose their very existence.    
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural']","The story focuses on a young adult named Atsushi Nakajima. After being kicked out of his orphanage, Atsushi stops the suicide of a detective named Osamu Dazai believing he was drowning in the river. During his interactions with Dazai, Atsushi learns he is gifted with a supernatural ability capable of transforming him into a berserker white tiger in the moonlight; this made the orphanage torture him and kick him out in the past. Dazai recruits him into the Agency and there he meets many other ability users as they tackle various cases and events taking place within the city of Yokohama, a place teeming with individuals with Supernatural Abilities. Atsushi becomes the target of the Port Mafia member Ry迂nosuke Akutagawa, as there is a bounty on his head on the black market.
During Atsushi's fights against the mafia, he also meets Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, the leader of the Fellowship of the Guild who placed the bounty on his head. Fitzgerald reveals there is a supernatural book capable of changing reality linked with Atsushi's tiger, hence putting a bounty on the black market. Fitzgerald disregards any superficial damage the Guild might bring to Yokohama in exchange for the book, having an airship named ""Moby Dick"" destroy the city. However, he is nearly killed by Atsushi and Akutagawa once joining forces while former mafia member Kyoka Izumi stops Moby Dick.
Another man known as Fyodor Dostoyevsky appears wishing to obtain the book to in order to erase all gifted people. He sets up a fatal clash between the detectives and the mafia but the true leader behind this organization, Natsume Soseki, stops the fight. While Atsushi and Akutagawa corner the virus' originator, Dazai manages to arrest Dostoyevsky with Fitzgerald's help. However, Dostoyevsky is later revealed to have orchestrated his own imprisonment in order to lead his followers. Pages of the book are later found by Dostoyevsky's group The Decay of Angels who uses its powers to frame the Agency for a murder case. Dazai is imprisoned alongside Dostoyevsky and the government sends its military forces known as the Hunting Dogs to execute the members from the Agency. As the Agency faces defeat, they form an alliance with Fitzgerald and the mafia in exchange for one of their followers. Across the multiple fights, it is revealed there is another person above Dostoyevsky and that person must be stopped. During an encounter with one of Fyodor's allies, Sigma, Atsushi discovers that the leader of Decay of Angels is a person codenamed Kamui. Ranpo Edogawa then manages to gather the Agency and prove their innocence to the law. After this, he uses his skills to determine Kamui's identity: ?chi Fukuchi, the leader of the Hunting Dogs. Upon being found, Fukuchi tries to kill Ranpo but is stopped Atsushi. Having realized Atsushi would not be able to face Fukuchi alone, Dazai had requested Akutagawa to aid. However, both Atsushi and Akutagawa are defeated by their enemy with the latter sacrificing himself in his last moments to let Atsushi escape.
","If having watched the first season, you are unsure whether its worth continuing on with the series, rest assured the second season is better. 
 
The story line for the second season is more series oriented rather than being episodic like the first season was. The first arc (which is more of a prequel), while annoying at first because it doesn't follow directly on from the first season, turned out to be very enjoyable. Episode 5 we return to the story that was set up at the end of the first season and other than one random episode about the super detective guy, it was non-stop action. 
 
Definitely recommend continuing with the series (unless you hated the first season, in which case, why are you even looking at this?)

          
 
       Helpful Bungou Stray Dogs adored by many but I come out of season 2 feeling a little eh. It was in no way shape or form so bad that it's unwatchable but considering the hype that surrounds it, I expected more. While in technicalities this was a pretty good sequel to the first season with lots of character and plot development, beautifully animated fight scenes and unique storyline I couldn't help but feel something was lacking. 
 Bungou Stray Dogs feels very rough around the edges, the main characters albeit Atsushi are well designed and interesting but Atsushi as the main character just doesn't do it for me. He of all characters felt the least developed and any improvement he did make was so lacklustre I couldn't find me caring. I was more moved by Akutagawa's growth until I found out he's just a whiny bitch dying for Dazai's approval. I did however really enjoy Dazai's backstory and Kyouka's arc and the over events in this season. 
 The storyline of this season was honestly engaging but I feel like they could have been dealt with in a better way. Every time something was getting interesting it was over and the anime moved on leaving me feeling like a whole lot of nothing happened.  
  The opening and closing songs were nothing special either but I did enjoy the animation in those sequences.  
  I think I will give season 3 a stab as I am invested in some of the characters but overall I have to say I'm expecting pretty big things from season 3 for it to live up to it's hype. 

          
 
       Helpful I wrote a review for the first season, but despite having ripped apart several aspects of the series, despite somewhat enjoying it overall, I still returned, hopeful that they would be able to impress me with the second season. And surprisingly, my hope paid off. 
 
Not only did they significantly improve on the methods through which the characters and character relationships were developed, but their attempt at creating an enticing storyline was unexpectedly impressive.  
 
Starting off the season with a full 4 episodes of context-building backstory regarding Dazai's past in the Port Mafia and why he betrayed them that did not rely on contrived, desperate plotlines or excess exposition but rather built a touching story in and of itself gave me refreshing new feelings towards this series as a whole.  
 
The concept of a shaky yet powerful alliance between the Port Mafia and Armed forces allows for natural character relationship development and backstory reveals, giving the storyline a natural flow that the first season somewhat missed out on by not giving the characters an ultimate goal. 
 
The more frequent references to the books written by the authors that inspired the characters finally gave the series the musty, bookshelf, literary air that I believe they hoped to create from the moment of its conception.  
 
Of course, several of the characters still are less than original (or possibly redrawn/recoloured versions of characters from other Anime), and while we now know that both the Port Mafia and the Armed forces love the city they share, this just makes me question why they were fighting in the first place more. 
 
However, the pleasant surprise of this second season being a good way to binge watch away my life at 2 am in the morning without getting bored has me in a good mood, so I shall partially overlook these aspects for now.  
 
Good series. I would recommend it to my peers, albeit not before reminding them that it gets a lot better in this second season.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Harem', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Mecha']","Kurou Daijuuji is a poor detective living in Arkham City. One day, he receives a request from Ruri Hadou of Hadou Financial Group to search for a magic book. While he initially refuses, Ruri offers him a large sum of money upon completion of her request, which leads Kurou to accept. As Kurou searches for the book, he unexpectedly runs into Al, a pretty girl that is actually a powerful grimoire. They forge a contract with each other, bestowing Kurou with powerful magic. Soon afterwards, Al also activates Demonbane, a deus machina owned by the Hadou Financial Group, to combat the mechanical menace from the Black Lodge, beginning the war between the Hadou Financial Group and the Black Lodge.
Demonbane takes place primarily in a region resembling the Lovecraft Country common to several of the Mythos stories, including Herbert West-Reanimator and The Shadow Over Innsmouth. The majority of the plot is confined to Arkham City, the home and headquarters of the Hadou Financial Group as well as the location of the Miskatonic University.  Arkham City is also the territory of a criminal organization known as the Black Lodge, which has access to an array of giant mecha as well as a number of powerful sorcerers that make it difficult for law enforcement to effectively combat.  A separate portion of the story is set in the coastal town of Innsmouth and one of the climactic battles takes place over the sunken city of R'lyeh.  The town of Dunwich is also referenced.
In the space above Earth, the Deus Machina Aeon clashes with another unknown machine but due to its lack of a ""master"" it is defeated and crashes on the surface of the planet.  Meanwhile, a starving Kurou Daij迂ji attempts to acquire food from a local church run by Sister Leica, a nun that he has known since he first moved to the city several years prior to the events of the story.  The next day, Kurou is approached by Ruri Hadou, the current head of the Hadou Financial Group and her butler, Winfield.  Ruri offers Kurou a job, citing his familiarity with the occult through his studies at the Miskatonic University: to procure a grimoire.  Unable to refuse the generous pay she is offering, Kurou agrees and begins searching immediately.
The search for an authentic grimoire is fruitless, until Kurou happens upon a previously unknown bookstore with several powerful books.  Unfortunately he is turned away by the store's owner, Nya, who cryptically states that a far more powerful grimoire is meant for him.  This prediction is later proven true when a mysterious girl falls out of the sky onto him, subsequently introduced as Al-Azif, the physical manifestation of the Necronomicon, one of the most powerful grimoires in existence.  Kurou is then attacked by her pursuers, the Black Lodge, under the command of the mad scientist Doctor West and forced by circumstances to enter into a contract with the grimoire.  Doctor West retreats, only to return in one of his giant Destroyer Robots.  Kurou escapes with the aid of Metatron, a masked hero that wages a one-man war against the Black Lodge, and stumbles upon an underground hangar containing an imitation Deus Machina, Demonbane.  After commandeering the mech amidst the protests of its owner, Ruri, Kurou and Al-Azif (or Al, for short) are able to defeat the Destroyer Robot.
Although initially incensed at the prospect of someone outside the Hadou family piloting Demonbane, Ruri agrees to employ Kurou as the Deus Machina's pilot.  Al wants to begin instructing him in the use of sorcery immediately, but before he has a chance to prepare, Kurou is attacked by the leader of the Black Lodge, Master Therion.  Kurou is immediately overpowered but his use of Demonbane forces Therion to reveal his own grimoire: the Pnakotic Manuscripts, also known as Etheldreda.  Therion spares Kurou's life, claiming that Kurou is the only individual who can alleviate his boredom, and vanishes.  Kurou then begins training in sorcery while simultaneously searching for and recapturing pages that Al has lost.  These pages eventually take on a life of their own and threaten the population, forcing him to subdue them physically before Al can reconstitute herself.  Kurou's interference in the Black Lodge's operations causes Master Therion to send two of his elite Anticross sorcerers, Titus and Tiberius, to attack the Hadou headquarters directly. Doctor West also repeatedly attempts to make up for his failure to capture the Necronomicon, assisted by a self-aware gynoid of his own creation named Elsa.  In one incident, West and Elsa are able to steal the pages relating to the Scimitar of Barzai and use them to create a copy of Demonbane that is subsequently defeated.
The story then moves to the coastal town of Innsmouth where Ruri has brought Kurou, Al, the Demonbane support team, and Leica on a beach holiday.  Sensing the presence of evil on an island off the coast, Kurou and Al begin investigating, accompanied by the rest of the group.  On the way they are attacked by Deep Ones and separated but each of the group is able to make their way to the island individually where they discover the inhabitants of Innsmouth, all Deep Ones themselves, performing a ritual to revive their god, Dagon. Overseeing them is another of the Anticross, Vespasianus, along with another powerful grimoire, the R'lyeh Text.  The ritual fails but Dagon is revived in an incomplete, bestial state.  The monster is only defeated when Demonbane channels the raw power of the Great Old One Cthugha, which nearly kills Kurou.  Kurou is later able to acquire Al's pages concerning another Great Old One, Ithaqua, and obtains a pair of handguns that serve as conduits for their power from a mysterious individual known to the Black Lodge as the Tyrant.
In the meantime, it is revealed that both the Necronomicon and the Tyrant are essential to a major Black Lodge undertaking, the C Project, but Master Therion appears unconcerned by the fact that his underlings have had no success in capturing either of them.  He placates the Anticross by explaining that he can use the Pnakotic Manuscripts in place of the Necronomicon and himself in place of the Tyrant but they remain unconvinced and plot rebellion behind his back.  Finally, when the stars are right, the Black Lodge begins a ritual that raises their secret headquarters, the Illusionary Heart Mother, into the sky.  They then reveal their full plan, using the R'lyeh Text to summon and bind another of the Great Old Ones: Cthulhu.  Using an army of Destroyer Robots and the wave of insanity that accompanies the summoning, the Black Lodge lays waste to Arkham City.  The Anticross betray Master Therion at the climax of the battle, seemingly destroying him along with Etheldreda, while Doctor West defects, disgusted by the perceived misuse of his technology.  While Demonbane is able to drive off the Destroyer Robots, the Illusionary Heart Mother is able to teleport away, the Anticross having gained control over Cthulhu through a series of emergency measures.
The Hadou Group is able to locate the missing fortress at 47∼9∩S 126∼43∩W and mobilises a multinational taskforce through its connections to begin an attack.  While they engage Cthulhu's forces in the sea, Demonbane is able to penetrate the fortress' defences and defeat the remaining Anticross.  Master Therion then reveals himself, reborn as a result of his unique parentage; his father is the Outer God Yog-Sothoth and the true purpose of the C Project was to sacrifice Cthulhu as the catalyst of a ritual to summon it.  Yog-Sothoth, the Gate and the Key, would then act as a portal through which the Outer Gods could then invade the physical universe. Therion challenges Kurou to follow him through the gate and, after saying his goodbyes, Kurou accepts.  Demonbane then battles Therion's Deus Machina, Liber Legis, throughout time and space leading to a clash between the most powerful weapon in each mech's possession: the Shining Trapezohedron.  Liber Legis is defeated but Al is finally able to access the totality of her sealed knowledge and discovers the identity of the one who orchestrated all of the story's events: Nya, also known as the Outer God Nyarlathotep. Kurou and Al battle the god and defeat it, preventing the destruction of reality. Nyarlathotep acknowledges its defeat but points out that it can always return with another scheme, leaving Demonbane becalmed in time and space.
","Although I am only on episode 2, I thought I would give a response on my initial view from these two episodes. It seems that there are negative comments for this anime, but in my view I find it quite fascinating. I do not like the entrance music, but the overall music isn't too bad. Pretty much what happens in this anime is a use of terms in a symbolic way and at the end you can read what each term means. I find it an interesting way to be informed on mythologies that I did not even know about.  
I would not recommend this anime to someone who does not have an interest in mythologies, because you will simply write a review as the ones that have already been posted speaking about how this is simply thrown together and just a  bad anime overall.  
I think it is that they cannot appreciate the interesting way of depicting mythology while at the same time teaching you about the mythology.  
So as a summation, I must say I quite enjoy it so far and I hope you understand what is so interesting about this anime before you watch it. If you do not like history and mythology then I advise you skip this anime because you will not enjoy it. 

          
 
       Helpful Well talking about demonbane, its worth watching... 
Though the music is so bad, artwork and story can make it worth.... 
Because artwork is so good. Every time we encounter the grimories, we feel like the character come alive.... 
And some battle graphics are good.. 
 
Other thing is that i expected a surprising and thrilling battle in the final episode but its not upto the mark, the final episode is little disappointing  to me..... 
 
Overall i suggest u to take a chance and try this if u love machine battles... :)

          
 
       Helpful This anime is a bit too complicated for me. I don't know if it's just because I'm slow or what, but it had so many complicated terms and side stories I can barely catch up.  
 
I did like the concept behind it. It was interesting, talking about grimoires and sorcery and combat, etc. but as I've said it tends to become complicated. The story is good, the execution, not so much. For one thing, there were way too many characters, and some of them popped up out of nowhere, in the middle of the story, making things more complicated. I ended the series without knowing what the woman-with-the-big-jugs' name was. 
 
The relationship between Kurou and Al was kind of bothersome. I know that Al is probably a 1000 year old person, but she looks so young. If I hadn't known her age I would think that she was around 13-15. I'd guess Kurou would be about 20 (since he went to &quot;college&quot;). It's just weird for me to see them so intimate with each other. Oh well.. I guess anything can happen in anime world. 
 
The graphics are great, specially the grimoires. They were all so nicely drawn. The guys weren't bad either, but Kurou's muscle tone kind of bothered me. He doesn't have a large frame, and yet you see muscles bulging out. 
 
The music wasn't bad. Most of the music were very upbeat and had high energy, like the opening song. I think it was something about God and machines. The ending song was a bit depressing, but I like it. I seem to like depressing and nostalgic songs, which makes me want to rethink seeing a therapist, but it's a wonderful song. Sad, but wonderful. 
 
I can't say it's one of my favorites, but it wasn't that bad either. I did finish it, and at the end of the series I kinda understood what it's about (but then again, I'm still not sure).

To help him on his venture, Yuusuke enlists ex-rival Kazuma Kuwabara, and two demons, Hiei and Kurama, who have criminal pasts. Together, they train and battle against enemies who would threaten humanity's very existence. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen']","YuYu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way. His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the Underworld (賜, Reikai, ""Spirit World"" in the English dub) where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of ""Underworld Detective"" (賜抻, Reikai Tantei, lit. ""Spirit World Detective"", ""Spirit Detective"" in the English dub), charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World (呯g賜, Ningen Kai, lit. ""Human World""). Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama, and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun, a shot of aura or Reiki (, Reiki, lit. ""Spirit Energy"") fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the Demon Plane (藹賜, Makai, lit. ""Demon World""), a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the Human World.
Yusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. To test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament (做\挕胍頗, Ankoku Bujutsukai, lit. ""Dark Martial Arts Association""), an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.
After the tournament, Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.
As they return to the Human World, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. 
Two years later, Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mukuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane. After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated, Koenma takes over his father's position and allows access between the Demon Plane and Human World. Genkai dies and leaves her estate to the cast. The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach.
","Yu Yu hakusho is one of your typical action based anime with comedy and a lot more. Even though it is so typical, there is still a lot more to offer because it will keep you interested until the end of the series (yes, it＊s a long series, 112 episodes to be exact).  
 
STORY - the story is about Yusuke Urameshi, a spirit detective, who became one when he died while saving a kid. He was given another chance to go back to the living provided that he will become a spirit detective. Since this is an action type anime, expect a lot of fighting. I enjoyed the the story because it does not show just ※fightings§. It also showcase the different stories that tackles emotions. The humor in this anime is not ※trying-hard§ type of humor. Most of it will also come to the throwing of lines of the characters in the series, and you will never know who of those characters might amuse you because everyone has its own.  
 
MUSIC/SOUND - i do love the opening and ending songs of this anime that made me listen to it over and over again.  
 
CHARACTERS - the four main characters have totally different package. It might be the same as the other action-type anime but still, the characters were justified by giving them unique stories, personalities and background. What made me like this is that the story did not evolve only to Yusuke but with all its supporting cast giving them enough air time to be introduced and be loved. I＊m sure that if you watched this anime, you will be able to love one of these characters, you might have ending liking also some of the antagonists in this anime. 
 
ART - This anime might not have the best art but whatever it lacks in the art was justified by having a lot of styles. The creative team and the stories kept me interested until the end. 
 
MY FAVORITE CHARACTER: 
Hiei Jaganashi - he＊s my favorite here because I totally love him being snobbish but will always be there for his sister Yukina and his friends. He has a bad history being abandoned by the town where he was born but was able to regain himself along with his long-time friend Kurama Minamino. Even though he＊s not the title role, he can definitely kick ass when it comes to fighting that also made Yusuke fear for some time. 
 
RATING: 9 
 
Well, what can i say, this is one of the anime that i grew up with. And all I can say is that I can＊t help compare all the action-type anime that i come across after this. Just like Dragon Ball Z.  
 
[A/N: You might agree or not with all the things I wrote down here, but of course, this is my opinion, I would love to hear you opinion as well. =) 
Please excuse any incorrect grammar, etc. And thanks for reading!

       Helpful This anime is outstanding because it is based on a great story where Spirit Detective Yusuke Urameshi has to team up with Kazuma Kuwabara,Yoko Kurama ( Minamoto Suichi ) and Hiei Jaganshi and save the Human World from demons. 
  I like the action, storyline, graphics ( Needs improvement though, but still outstanding !!!) and the Cool Super Powers that each one of those character has,its just outstanding. 
  I also like how they put the Saga's together,they're only 4 Saga's,which is good.Unlike Dragonball ( Z,GT etc...),which has alot of Saga's,the makers of Yuu Yuu Hakusho knew that if they put in too many Saga's,the whole anime would be messed up. 
  I do wish they add another Saga and more episodes though,i think about 6 Saga's would be enough and 201 Episodes would be enough although i think i watched 201 already so i think someone got the number wrong (112). 
 
This Review refers to my feelings towards the anime Yuu Yuu Hakusho, it truly does not help anyone in anyway possible.........haha...

          
 
       Helpful This series is a bit older, but it's one of the few that holds up really well. It has a solid cast of characters, and it has a simple but well done story line. It is full of comedy and has a great cast of voice actors supporting it.  
 
It is your typical fighting story where the main character gets stronger as he needs to defeat each opponent, but he's a brawling tough guy from the beginning. He develops his skills through his solid determination as he needs to overcome each trial that he faces. This is one of the series that helped set the bar for the genre, and it's one that shouldn't be overlooked. 
 
Yusuke is a delinquent in the beginning of the story, but he isn't really a bad guy. He has a bad rep due to the fact that none of the other delinquents can defeat him, so he is pretty well feared. Thanks to his death that wasn't supposed to happen (I don't want to spoil anything but there's a great quote in the beginning about his death), one thing leads to another and he ends up having to prove he deserves a second chance at life. With his newly regained life comes the new responsibility of working for the spirit world hunting down demons as a spirit detective. Many quirky things happen, but the ride is definitely a fun one to watch. 
 
My biggest complaint is that my favorite part of the story is the shortest (the last story arc), but you can never have too much of a good thing. This anime is a great adaptation of the manga series, and it even pieces together a solid ending that is slightly different than the manga but works well. Even though this is older, I do highly recommend adding this to your list of must watch anime.

16,31478,67,4.854520884,Detective and his or her helper,Bungou Stray Dogs,"For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be aware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city. 
 
While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning. Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle, alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural']","The story focuses on a young adult named Atsushi Nakajima. After being kicked out of his orphanage, Atsushi stops the suicide of a detective named Osamu Dazai believing he was drowning in the river. During his interactions with Dazai, Atsushi learns he is gifted with a supernatural ability capable of transforming him into a berserker white tiger in the moonlight; this made the orphanage torture him and kick him out in the past. Dazai recruits him into the Agency and there he meets many other ability users as they tackle various cases and events taking place within the city of Yokohama, a place teeming with individuals with Supernatural Abilities. Atsushi becomes the target of the Port Mafia member Ry迂nosuke Akutagawa, as there is a bounty on his head on the black market.
During Atsushi's fights against the mafia, he also meets Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, the leader of the Fellowship of the Guild who placed the bounty on his head. Fitzgerald reveals there is a supernatural book capable of changing reality linked with Atsushi's tiger, hence putting a bounty on the black market. Fitzgerald disregards any superficial damage the Guild might bring to Yokohama in exchange for the book, having an airship named ""Moby Dick"" destroy the city. However, he is nearly killed by Atsushi and Akutagawa once joining forces while former mafia member Kyoka Izumi stops Moby Dick.
Another man known as Fyodor Dostoyevsky appears wishing to obtain the book to in order to erase all gifted people. He sets up a fatal clash between the detectives and the mafia but the true leader behind this organization, Natsume Soseki, stops the fight. While Atsushi and Akutagawa corner the virus' originator, Dazai manages to arrest Dostoyevsky with Fitzgerald's help. However, Dostoyevsky is later revealed to have orchestrated his own imprisonment in order to lead his followers. Pages of the book are later found by Dostoyevsky's group The Decay of Angels who uses its powers to frame the Agency for a murder case. Dazai is imprisoned alongside Dostoyevsky and the government sends its military forces known as the Hunting Dogs to execute the members from the Agency. As the Agency faces defeat, they form an alliance with Fitzgerald and the mafia in exchange for one of their followers. Across the multiple fights, it is revealed there is another person above Dostoyevsky and that person must be stopped. During an encounter with one of Fyodor's allies, Sigma, Atsushi discovers that the leader of Decay of Angels is a person codenamed Kamui. Ranpo Edogawa then manages to gather the Agency and prove their innocence to the law. After this, he uses his skills to determine Kamui's identity: ?chi Fukuchi, the leader of the Hunting Dogs. Upon being found, Fukuchi tries to kill Ranpo but is stopped Atsushi. Having realized Atsushi would not be able to face Fukuchi alone, Dazai had requested Akutagawa to aid. However, both Atsushi and Akutagawa are defeated by their enemy with the latter sacrificing himself in his last moments to let Atsushi escape.
","Well yeah before it came out, I was reall hyped up because of the description plus the seiyuu lineup (not having read the manga and all), and while watching it progress into 12 episodes, it did become more typical shounen (especially the MC). HOWEVER, for some reason, I kinda liked it more than the other shounen animes I've seen. I can't quite explain it, maybe it's the reference to several literary geniuses? Maybe it was the art and music? Or maybe the side characters (though quite a lot) were interesting? Maybe I found the humor cute? I'm not so sure, but I DID LOVE IT. 
 
I didn't drop it (lie I did to the other animes of the season) because even if the MC was sort of generic, there were others who really stood out. It also helped a lot that the OSTs are amazing.  


          
 
       Helpful What happens when you get together a special group of individuals based off famous literacy authors? The answer is Bungou Stray Dogs. Only this time, they have special abilities in a world where there＊s mystery, crime, and all other sorts of dark phenomenon that will take your breath away. Based off the manga of the same name, this is a show that can be easily recommendable to almost anyone. But if you＊re a fan of supernatural mystery, it＊ll be an exception treat. 
 
Bungou Stray Dogs is prime proof that supernatural fiction can still work in attractive fashion. The show stars a group of characters as part of the group known as the Armed Detective Agency, who specializes in missions to solve dangerous cases. It offers a select group of individuals with their own unique talents, traits, and ways that makes us wonder about their everyday life style. Then, we also meet Atsushi Nakajima, the main protagonist who got kicked out of his orphanage and ends up becoming a member of the Agency himself. It＊s like fate connected his life together with these individuals in a story of innovative wonders. 
 
If you＊ve seen The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or something along that line, then watching this show will feel a bit familiar. On paper, it＊s a pretty cool looking show with a cast of badass characters named after famous literary works. Not only that, their special powers are also based off of their well-known literature. The first episodes establishes a blend between mystery, supernatural, and black comedy. In fact, the show easily crafts a mood that is rather comical with the way Osamu Dazai is introduced. I mean think about it, the guy tries to commit suicide in an absurd fashion until Atsushi decides to save him. Throughout the show, his relationship with Dazai can be viewed as bizarre. This also expands to many other characters because truth to be told, Atsushi really is like the new kid in class. Other characters he gets associated with such as Junchirou Tanizaki, Doppo Kunikda, Ranpo Edogawa, Akiko Yosano, and Kenji Miyazaza also brings the best and worst out of him. Throughout the series, it＊s also shown that he is perhaps the most ※human§ out of all the characters. He is very ordinary and has low confidence in himself from the beginning. The revelation regarding his own powers also makes him feel like he＊s a walking curse and that misfortune follows those who he encounters. Now you＊re probably asking why you should care. The main factor is that Atsushi needs to realize that not everyone can be saved. Kunikda realizes this and constantly reminds himself and others that it＊s a cruel world they live in. And that＊s a lot to say about the show. The world setting of Bungou Stray Dogs has mafias, underworld organizations, and crimes that goes beyond imaginations. 
 
The story structure sets up the show nicely with its first two episodes. I will emphasize that as part of the series, comedy also plays a large factor to perhaps decide whether you＊d like to continue watching or not. For some, this can be very entertaining in the form of popcorn comedy. For others, it can be distracting and even annoying. Director Igarashi Takuya puts his talent at the table and his previous work with Ouran Koukou Host Club can feel familiar to those who recognizes it. That is to say, the comedy may not be suitable for everyone, in particular the timing. The adaptation itself is also quite faithful with panel by panel. It also brings in the violence that gives the show a darker tone mixed in with the humor and jokes. However, I will mention that the show does go off for two episodes around mid-season (not based on the manga). Also, the plan to adapt the series is split into 2-cours (12 episodes ach) and this review will cover the first half. 
 
As some may expect, the Armed Detective Agency also attracts enemies. This is where the Port Mafia comes in as they are introduced. Working from the shadows with mysterious origins, we also meet Ryunosuke Akutagawa, mysterious member of Port Mafia who seems to have a history with Dazai. Other members introduced in the mafia also shows their ruthlessness and lack of care for human life such as terrorist bomber Momojiro Kaji. The point is that the show makes them the main antagonists for the first cour, an antithesis to what Atsushi believes in. At one point, he even meets a young girl known for the murder of 35 people yet still hopes there＊s some redemption for her. 
 
As I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs is a cool looking show, literally. The characters portrays some unique personalities with their own personal powers. From tiger transformation to bringing objects into existence by just writing in a notebook, the show demonstrates the capability of attracting fan of supernatural fiction. Unfortunately, I can＊t say that the mystery is very impressive. It＊s actually pretty straightforward although sparks quite the curiosity about characters＊ background stories. What I mean is more of the cases that is rather predictable and some of them actually feels repetitive by nature.  
 
Bones helms the series and once again shows that they are capable of capturing the magic of supernatural genre. Character abilities not only looks cool but also decoratively presented in fashion that is extraordinary. Speaking of the characters, each of them has some unique appearance that makes them stand out in one way or another. From the carefree expressions of Dazai to the mischievous Akiko, it has something to offer for anyone. There＊s also a prominence of male characters with bishounen-like characteristics so female fans may find this series a nice sight to look at. The action speaks pretty much for itself with good amount of violence, choreography, and battle theatrics. I can also confess that most of the character expressions in the anime is done better than the manga. 
 
Soundtrack is a nice way to make the show more entertaining as well. From the OP song by Trash Candy to the battle OST, it gives the pleasure of what supernatural battles are all about. Character voice mannerism can also be praised especially for guys like Akutagawa＊s sinister tone or Daizai＊s sarcastic personality. Because the show is known for its catchy dialogues, the voice mannerism has to be portrayed with credibility and the voice actors/actresses does just that. 
 
It is what it is. Bungou Stray Dogs is pretty much a show that can be watched by anyone from the beginning without any knowledge about literature. That being said, the comedy can feel like a bit of the hit or miss category. After the introductory episodes, the story does pick up quite a bit so patience is a key to enjoy the show. Luckily, there＊s an adequate amount of entertainment provided by the unique cast of characters, themes, and storytelling so be prepared for a wild ride. It＊s one that you＊ll someday come back and realize how fun it was. 


          
 
       Helpful With another season of anime, comes another supernatural-action title that attempts to be unique, different and original while keeping faithful to its genre. Bungo Stray Dogs (BSD, from now on) is most definitely unique arguably ingenious, but has several, painful shortcomings that unfortunately add it to the vast collection of mediocre supernatural-action anime.  
 
 
Before anyone watches this anime, I highly recommend you watch The Canipa Effect＊s great video on the characters of Bungo Stray Dogs. You will appreciate the ingenuity of the story and understand the characters better once you learn about the Japanese literarians they＊re based on.  
 
 
STORY: Quickly said, BSD is a poorly told good story. As I mentioned previously, the premise of writing the main characters and their ※gifts§ based on famous Japanese literarians is ingenious, and due to the limited cultural awareness of the non-Japanese watchers on MAL, this ingenuity has unfortunately gone unnoticed and unpraised. One must be culturally aware of the Japanese literature references in order to fully appreciate the anime＊s story, but sadly even so, it remains poorly told. While basing characters on famous literarians is certainly original and unique, it has its drawbacks and limitations. The main characters in BSD all have unique, supernatural abilities (called ※gifts§), and these abilities are denominated after their respective literarian＊s most famous works. For example, Osamu Dazai＊s ability is named after his literarian counterpart＊s book, ※No Longer Human§. This is where problems begin to arise. Due to the vagueness and obscurity of these ability names, several characters have gifts that are inexplicably overpowered and one can only wonder the weaknesses and limitations of said power. The majority of gifts in the show are so powerful that they almost always bend the rules of the show＊s universe, and this results in several plot holes during fights when characters conveniently seem to forget how insanely overpowered their gifts are. The source of the gifts is not explained once, and several abilities are explained with convoluted logic that is hard to digest. 
 
The beginning of the show is extremely typical, the protagonist (Atsushi) is down on his luck and saves a drowning man (Dazai) who was actually trying to kill himself. Dazai and Atsushi are then tracked down by the upstanding, strict supporting character (Kunikida) who is then forced to treat Atsushi to a meal. Attach an unnecessary amount of slapstick comedy and you can already you can see where this show is sort of going, and while the beginning is typical and cliche there＊s nothing really wrong with it. The execution of it was pretty good and as a result came off as a funny way to introduce the characters. By the end of the first episode, Atsushi is recruited to the Detective Agency, which is a legal police force where they only recruit members with the supernatural gifts aforementioned.  
 
The plot progression of BSD is driven by several plot contrivances and conveniences, and the source material was adapted in such an odd way that there end up being around 4-6 episodes centered around a bomb and 3 of these are back to back. This results in a tiring, unpleasant and repetitive watch that honestly lost my interest several times. The slapstick comedy in the show was especially annoying and often ruined the tone of several serious scenes. The comedy was often unoriginal and quickly grew repetitive and annoying. 
 
The main antagonist group of the show is the Port Mafia, and if you are to believe that they are going to be the biggest, toughest forces the Detective Agency are going to face you are dead wrong. The Port Mafia is often portrayed as an ever present overwhelming power that threatens the safety of all the civilians and detectives in the city, but in reality, are basically a rival, evil counterpart to the Detective Agency. Several members of the Port Mafia come off as incompetent and weak and sometimes you wonder if they really live up to the dangerous threat that they＊re often portrayed as. Towards the end of the series you are briefly introduced to a flurry of characters that are very clearly the true, underlying antagonists of the show and they are much, much more interesting than the main antagonist of this season, Akutagawa. It seems what anyone should take from this season is that it is building a foundation for what is to come this fall, and I would say they＊ve successfully (although slowly, boringly and sometimes poorly), built a strong foundation. Hopefully next season uses this foundation to their advantage and is able to be much better. 
 
This is all not to say that BSD is not an enjoyable watch. As I mentioned, BSD is a poorly told good story, leaving the plot to have a few profound and several unpredictable moments that caught me off guard in a good way. The concept behind each character＊s gifts and the main antagonist of the show was enough to keep me invested while it was airing and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this show＊s run and I＊m excited for the next season.  
 
CHARACTERS: BSD has been renewed for a second cour this fall, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that several of the other supporting characters will be developed next season. But for now, most of the characters in BSD are pretty dimensionless and some are just plain stupid. Atsushi and Kunikida are the only characters developed over the course of the show, while the rest are simply background characters. Atsushi is your run off the mill protagonist; a little cowardly, strong-willed, naturally talented and offers a naive perspective due to a lack of experience. At first his backstory was handled maturely, sad yet not quite melodramatic. That is of course until they repeatedly flash back to one scene from Atsushi＊s orphanage every single episode. This show brutally beats you over the head with Atsushi's orphanage backstory to the point where it often breaks tense moments out of repetitiveness.  
 
Osamu Dazai is arguably a Gary Stu (No Longer Human ability, hello!?) and that＊s perfectly fine and often fitting for his role as Atsushi's ※savior§. Dazai is Atsushi's role-model and is what he strives to be a detective from the Agency, and it had (or has, maybe the second season will do this) potential to be an interesting and complex relationship. However, for most of the show the interactions are between Kunikida and Atsushi, as Kunikida is often left in charge of him. Their character dynamics are quite interesting especially considering that they are great foils. Kunikida is studious, prideful and driven by his ideals. Atsushi is often weak hearted, modest, and is driven by his desire to be a human worthy of life. Their conversations and interactions are funny and often very profound. 
 
 
AUDIOVISUALS: Produced by Studio Bones, the animation of BSD is excellent. The fight scenes are animated with great colours along with great fighting choreography. Some of the character abilities are inherently boring and as a result usually make up for some boring fights, but they are nonetheless animated beautifully. Kept me at the edge of my seat and greatly anticipating several badass action scenes due to the immersiveness of its animation. BSD also has a great opening that gets you hyped for the show every time you watch it, and a great ED that is often extended to the final scenes of several episodes for dramatic effect (similar to JoJo＊s roundabout ending extending). All in all a well animated show with very few boring panning frames.  
 
Enjoyment 7/10: Despite my qualms with the show it kept me invested for the most part and I enjoyed watching it. I was excited for every episode when it aired and I readily await the second season. 
 
Overall 5/10: The show is not bad, but not necessarily good. The quality of the story and characters is very mediocre and all the supernatural abilities could have been the shows saving grace but end up being poorly explained and ridiculously overpowered. I＊d recommend this show to anyone who isn＊t overly picky and unnecessarily analytical and simply prefers to be entertained by their anime.

16,1844,68,4.823733095,Detective and his or her helper,Clamp Gakuen Tanteidan,"The CLAMP school, with its integrated curriculum from kindergarten to post-graduate studies, was founded by the largest of Japanese business empires, the House of Imonoyama. Funded entirely out of its own deep pockets, it was hoped that the school would be a haven for young men and women on whose shoulders our future would rest. 
 
The School is open to any talented individual, irrespective of his or her lineage or financial standing and is known to count scores of singularly talented pupils. It is furthermore also famous for its harboring of a remarkable percentage of party animals. Not even the bright and talented minds of CLAMP School can keep the campus free of crimes and mysteries. Or can they? Join Nokoru, Suoh and Akira, our case-cracking kid detectives, as they save the day and even the odd damsel in distress! 
 
(Source: Bandai Entertainment)","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Shoujo']","The Clamp School Detectives is a series of episodic cases.
","The kingdom of Clamp has been extremely well known in Japan. I originally came upon this show because i am a huge fan of clamp and i really enjoyed alot of their other works such as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles one of my favorite clamp manga's. Other works include X/1999, Chobits, Card captor sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, XXXholic. Initially i was very excited to watch this show seeing as how i loved all of clamps creations how ever i was a bit let down. 
 
The setting for this series revolves around this large school comprised of bout 10,000 students with many different divisions and many activities, academics, athletics, and just bout anything you can think of.  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira are the 3 main protagonists of the series and are also the lead council members of the elementary division. These three kids must solve many cases around the school of certain mysterious happenings, usually involving a damsel in distress. 
 
Later on as you get a little further into the show, some of the main players of the series start to develop relationships with these elementary kindergarten females which is a nice touch, and the romance is not shown as true love which it shouldn't be given the fact that these characters are pretty underage. But i do appreciate how each relationship with these two female casts grow as you get further in the show and they start to be a part of the clamp school detectives. 
 
I think the strongest aspect of this show is the characters. The nice thing about the trio of protagonists is that they each bring something different to the show. Nokoru is the youngest son of the founders of the Clamp School and is essentially a prodigy in every sense of the word. Suoh is nearly as sharp as Nokoru, but where he lacks in the powers of observation he makes up for with his physical attributes. Akira is the youngest of the three. He's a little more na?ve, a better cook, and sees things more optimistically than his friends. They play off each other quite nicely and right from the very first episode they have a chemistry that easily carries the weight of 26 episodes. 
 
At first glance i thought this would be a series that focuses more on like mysterious happenings and murder cases, because the first episode kind of gives you that impression, but really most of the cases they solve are trying to help some lady that is in trouble, because of the episodic nature of the show, each case involves a different scenario.  
 
Although their is one particular plot in the show that takes place towards the end, the last 6 episodes with a more straightforward story and the introduction of a rather intriguing character. This story really caught my attention. It was much different then former episodic nature of the plot and a little more on a serous level, though the idea behind it was rather predictable, it still held my attention.  Which i thought was really the only thing that redeemed this anime series as far as the simplistic progression of the story. Which is why i rated it a 6 and not lower. 
 
If your a fan of clamp though, this series may be enjoyable, but if you have not seen other clamp works, i highly recommend you pass on this one and watch other great works from clamp. Other wise if you have nothing else to watch and are a clamp fanatic and want to watch every clamp in existence then give this one a shot as a last resort, then you may enjoy this series to an extent depending upon your tastes. 
 


          
 
       Helpful CLAMP School Detectives is a 90s anime based on a CLAMP manga. And it is, in my opinion, a very entertaining show. I just finished this series and decided to write a review about it - my first review, actually. Here we go. 
 
? Story - 9/10 
 
In the first 20 episodes there isn't a story. We follow the lives of three elementary school boys that happen to be in the Elementary School Council and are also (self-proclaimed) detectives. They - well, mostly their ""leader"", Nokoru, wants to help all the ladies he sees in trouble. He doesn't want to see any girl crying and is willing to do anything to help her. So the boys get in a lot of situations, some funny ones, some troublesome ones, and some actually dangerous ones. To achieve their goals they do things that real children aren't able to do - that most people aren't able to do, actually. In some episodes they actually have to solve cases, follow clues to find things, and they have the help of other characters, especially two girls from the school's kindergarten. Those two girls are also supposed to be the romantic interests of two of the main boys, but of course, they are all children, so the ""love"" in this show is represented as the most pure thing in the world, and nothing is sexualized, in case there was someone worried about it.  
Later in the series, the ""villain"" makes his appearance, so we have a more serious atmosphere and an actual plot. 
 
? Art/Animation - 9/10 
 
CLAMP 90s artstyle, it's simply gorgeous. I don't have much to talk about it, I just have a soft spot for oldschool art. 
 
? Sound - 8/10 
 
The soundtrack, all composed by Ali Project, isn't very memorable, but it wasn't bad at all; it did its job perfectly, fitting the show pretty well. The opening song is very catchy, and the endings were both good, especially the second one, but also not very memorable. 
The voice actors were great at their roles, I have nothing to complain about them. 
 
? Characters - 10/10 
 
All of them have different personalities and are very likeable. Our protagonists are all children. Three boys at age 11~12; Nokoru Imonoyama, who is the president of the ESC, is a bit irresponsible, but very kind, and really cares for the people he loves, and for the whole CLAMP Academy; Suoh Takamura is the serious type, he really respects Nokoru but also gets really mad at the his lack of responsibility; and Akira Ijyuin, who is also the main character of the manga 20 Mensou ni Onegai!!, is the youngest one, he enjoys cooking and is probably the most childish of the three boys. 
The two girls, Nagisa Azuya and Utako Ohkawa, are members of the Kindergarten School Council, they often help or are helped by the main boys.  
Some characters from other CLAMP manga series make some appearances, like Kentaro, Takeshi, Eri and Sukiyabashi, from School Defenders Duklyon and Miyuki from Miyuki-chan in Wonderland. 
Other characters usually show up in only one or two episodes. 
 
? Enjoyment - 10/10 
 
I loved it. I thought the manga was a good series to pass time, but nothing actually special, but I had a lot of fun watching the anime. It was really cute and amusing. Even though it's mostly episodic, the cases never get boring. 
 
? Overall - 9/10 
 
If you are into light-hearted stories, isn't worried about realism, and enjoy episodic series, I'd suggest you to give CLAMP School Detectives a shot! 

          
 
       Helpful Let me start of by saying this anime was created by the one and only CLAMP.  
 
Now that you know let me start my review. 
 
 
CLAMP Gakuen Tanteidan, or CLAMP School Detectives, is the story of three little investigators  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira, who are also members of the three-person elementary student council of their school.  
I guess this has a good story but I didn't see any goal in it. What do they want to happen? What are they trying to find? The only thing I see happening in this anime are there life and times inside the school. They beat bad guys up and discovers themselves after some time.  
It has, fortunately, some exciting action. Kids beating up bad guys looks cool. 
 
Storylines' a bit(just a bit) lame but I give the art some praise. The drawings are very detailed and pretty advanced for its time. The hair-blowing is also pretty good. 
Though I'm a guy I cannot resist saying... the characters are so cute and adorable. 
 
The music is nice. The pretty sound of the singers' voices are very likable. The opening and ending theme, however, is a letdown for me because it had nothing to do with the anime's plot. Little boys and girls pausing beautifully for the audience. 
Once fangirls see them screaming is unavoidable. 
 
The characters are fair enough. Nokoru for me is the blonde eminence of Shuichi Minamino. Suoh is an all around serious character with a pure heart which kind of reminds me of CLAMP's very own Li Shaoran who I like very much. Akira is adorable enough. I felt the girls never contributed anything except blow their pheromone all over Nokoru's staff. 
&quot;I'll give my life to this kindergartener.&quot; One of them said.  
 
Enjoyment... I can't explain much. I found the action very cool and the character design great. I did not like the storyline and romance though.  
 
My overall score is 7 out of 10. This might not appeal much to hardcore fans but it's perfect for kids or beginners.

","~Let's La~ ANIME REVIEW~ 
Story: Honestly,they had a good thing going with the story. I had high hopes. Alas, I was disappointed. At first, I thought it was going to be a lighthearted, fun Precure season, but it soon became clear that it would become more depressing.  
 
Character: It was soon revealed that all the Precure had mental illnesses. It was just depressing. They also made it so that I had no attatchment to the characters whatsoever. They didn't connect with me as much as the other Cures. I really hated Cure Parfait becuase of how they introduced her and how much stronger she was than the cures. 
 
Overall: I am in love with the precure fanchaise, but this truly is disappointing.

          
 
       Helpful ""Kira Kira Pretty Cure Ala Mode"" it's the 14 season of the franchise ""Pretty cure"" also now as ""Glitter Force"" outside of Japan.... 
 
This is called the worst season of the franchise ever made by the fans and... I don't now, i still thinking than ""Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure"" it's worse, but... That means than this is good? 
 
Not really, actually it's pretty bad. 
 
Characters: 
 
They are the same archetypes that the franchise has been reusing for several years ... Now, there would be no problem with the archetypes if they were to use them well, but these characters are painfully one-dimensional. 
 
The protagonist has an excess of time on the screen and never develops a true personality ... they only tell us how it feels more than showing them, simply a generic Precure protagonist. 
 
The other girls are there simply, their only excitement is that they must accompany the protagonist ... And also the fact of some forced drama they have at some point. 
 
Cure macaron and cure chocolate are simple copies of Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus and the villains are quite generic ... in the sense that everything they do, say or plan has already been seen many times in the franchise and anime in general 
 
Story: 
 
Similar to the characters, the plot is the same formula that the franchise has reused for years ... Now, they would not have a problem with it if they executed it correctly. 
 
But the problem is that they have no interest in telling us that formula in a way that could be remotely interesting ... They just want to tell it as quickly as they can, in order to generate toys that they can sell with it. 
 
It is pretty mediocre. 
 
Animation: 
 
 
The animation is normal, the designs are pretty moe, the colors are bright and flashy and the battle scenes are well choreographed. 
 
I also want to highlight the incredible CGI that the series has, La franqucia pretty cure has the best CGI I've seen in anime. 
 
Music: 
 
the music is passable, the songs are catchy and the voice acting very regular. 
 
There is not really a musical soundtrack and the few pieces that were there were quite generic. 
 
nothing special and forgettable 
 
I think if I had been 10 years old I would have enjoyed this show more ... But I'm not a child and it made me painfully bored. 
 
but I think I would see it if I ever have children. 


          
 
       Helpful Kira Kira is one of the many seasons of Precure and I decided to write this review in order to help you decide if you want to dive in or save your time. (This is a spoiler-free review) 
 
Despite their animal appearance, this season＊s theme is sweets. If you are unfamiliar with precure, the gist is that the first 10-15 episodes are typically character building and world building. The midway point is a turning point in the plot and the introduction of a new main character. The last 20-25 episodes advance the plot, round out the characters, redeem the villains, and solve the conflict. However this season falls short on many of these aspects. 
 
Characters: 
The good: The main 6 cures are the saving grace of this season. They each receive their own respective character episodes and go through challenges that lead to proper development. Previous seasons have shown favoritism however in Kira Kira they all have multiple chances to shine throughout the season. The character designs are also beautiful and very unique, especially for a precure season. 
The bad: It is extremely common for villains in magical girl anime to be redeemed. However in Kira Kira, after the villains receive their well-deserved redemption, they are cast aside. Their character is barely explored any further and their goals and aspirations are never mentioned again (particularly in reference to Julio, the first villain). Kira Kira dedicates a lot of time getting you to love these characters but instead of being a moving experience, you＊re left with a lot of questions, disappointment, and a longing for more. 
 
The Plot: 
Precure starts off slow however Kira Kira feels like a painful waiting game. Episode after episode went by without any clue as to who the main villain was and what his goal was. In fact, it isn＊t revealed until episode 46ish that we find out anything about the villain＊s past and his goals. The evil just feels like its for the fun of it and the ending battle feels like a breeze. In fact, its so over the top that you might even have a laugh or two. Sweets that someone spends time perfecting and creating for someone they love is full of powerful and wonderful feelings called Kira Kiraru but why are the villains trying to steal this power? What is the enemy＊s ultimate goal? You will be asking this for 46 episodes and even then the answer is vague, confusing and lackluster. If you are here for story, you will end episode 48 with a giant question mark. 
 
Combat:  
I really wanted to talk about the combat in this season. Past Precure seasons have shown battles almost as intense as Dragon Ball Z. The girls typically beat the snot out of the enemy after getting thrown around like rag dolls themselves. Now I don＊t think violence is necessarily essential but in Kira Kira, the girls simply wave their flashy wands and wrap their enemies up with cream and almost immediately the evil is defeated. There was no growth for their powers. They started off strong, they ended equally as strong. They were perfect super heroes from episode 1 until episode 49. The evil was never even as a real threat and it just felt mediocre. They didn＊t experience despair for more than 5 minutes at a time, they never had consequences or loss due to their actions. They never have to do anything other than jump around and wiggle their arm back in forth in order to triumph over the evil. Not only was the entertainment aspect not there but who cares about a hero with plot armor so thick that the victory is basically wrapped up in a bow and hand delivered to them by their enemy? 
 
Sound and Animation: 
This season was aesthetically pleasing. As far as I can recall, there are about 4 off-model episodes out of 49 which is quite good for Toei. The animation is absolutely wonderful, the character＊s movements are smooth and suit their personality. Their expressions are cute, comical and emotional when need be. The music in this season is absolutely stunning. The OST (including the vocal album) is enchanting, heart-warming and actually saves some of the more mediocre scenes. When something is supposed to be emotional in the plot but it falls short, the music desperately holds it together. The opening song is catchy, the first end song is meh and the second end song is very very enjoyable. The vocal album this season also felt like a lot more time had been dedicated to it. 
 
 
Overall:  
It wasn＊t a terrible experience but it wasn＊t the best one. I looked forward to watching the episodes but unfortunately the ending never came to fruition. I desperately try to give Precure the benefit of the doubt since it is a children＊s show but that excuse can only go so far (especially since past precure seasons have pulled off amazing plot lines with amazing characters). If you are looking for a Precure season to watch I suggest Go! Princess Precure and Heartcatch to start off. If you are someone who follows Precure, we can only hope next season delivers.

They have the honour of beginning a new revolution in gaming; however, their carefree fun is cut short when a company employee is found murdered, with his dying message pointing to a clue hidden within the Ark. 
 
Along with the Detective Boys and Ran Mouri, Conan Edogawa enters Noah's Ark to solve this mystery and ensure the perpetrator is caught. But once they're inside the Ark, it takes on a mind of its own, imprisoning them and the children within its worlds. To escape and bring the murderer to justice, Conan and company must navigate a simulated 19th century London and track down the infamous Jack the Ripper〞with the lives of 50 innocent children depending on them. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Shounen']","Child prodigy Hiroki Sawada〞who, by the age of ten, is already a MIT grad student and has developed a DNA Tracker software〞has been under the guardianship of Thomas Schindler, CEO of the software giant Schindler, Inc., since his mother died. One night, in a heavily guarded room at the top of the Schindler building where Hiroki lives, he finishes an artificial intelligence system, Noah's Ark, and sends the software through the telephone lines. The guards become suspicious when he does not respond. They bust open the door, but discover that Hiroki has disappeared, apparently having leapt off the building.
Two years later, at the Beika City Hall, Schindler, Inc., holds a demonstration of an immersive virtual reality game called Cocoon. Conan, Richard, Rachel and the Detective Boys (including Haibara Ai) are attending the demonstration, but cannot participate without special badges, which have been allocated to children associated with the game's investors and prominent socialites such as Serena. Dr. Agasa and Booker Kudo, who have been involved in the development of the game's setting, attend the event. Agasa gives Conan a badge, while the other Junior Detective kids trade Premium Golden Yaiba Cards for badges.
When security discovers that Kashimura, a top employee of Schindler, Inc., has been killed. Booker and Conan rush to investigate. Discovering that  Kashimura's keyboard has blood stains on three of the keys (R, T, and J), Conan decides to participate in the demonstration, hoping that the game would lead him to an answer. Booker reasons out that J-T-R stands for ""Jack the Ripper"".
When the demonstration begins, Hiroki's artificial intelligence system, Noah's Ark, announces it has taken control, but it tells the audience that if none of the fifty kids are able to survive the game, it will kill the kids in reality using a large electromagnetic burst. The kids must choose one of five types of games while the audience watch helplessly, unable to shut the game down. Conan and the Junior Detectives choose the fifth, a re-creation 19th century London set in the world of Sherlock Holmes. Conan and his friends track down 221B Baker Street, only to find that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are at Dartmoor. Since Holmes cannot help, the kids find Sebastian Moran and Professor Moriarty. Moriarty tells Conan that he trained Jack the Ripper when Jack was a street urchin. The professor gives the children a clue about the next victim, who turns out to be Irene Adler, Holmes's only love. Some of the events lead to more kids being eliminated from the game, including the Junior Detectives. Meanwhile, in the real world, Booker investigates the case and reveals that Kashimura's murderer is the company's president, Thomas Schindler, who Hiroki had discovered was a descendant of the original Jack the Ripper.
Eventually only three are left: Conan, Rachel, and another child named Hideki Moroboshi. They follow Jack the Ripper to a train and reveals Jack among the passengers. However, Jack captures Rachel and sets the train on a runaway course. After being unable to stop the train, Conan and Hideki confront Jack on top of the train where he has tied himself to Rachel. Hoping that Conan can figure out the situation, Rachel sacrifices herself by jumping off the train and into a ravine, pulling Jack with her. As Conan begins to lose hope, Sherlock Holmes appears and gives Conan some useful advice that eventually helps Conan and Hideki survive the game when the train crashes into the station.
After winning the game, Conan reveals that Hideki is actually Hiroki, who has manifested himself as Noah's Ark. In a private conversation, Hiroki says he was satisfied with the outcome, as he was hoping the kids can paint a brighter future than their parents, and that he was happy he could also participate as a player in the game. He releases the children from the game and then erases himself.
","This movie used to be one of my least favorites in the series. Back then, I found it to be weird and somewhat contrived. I understand that this statement may displease some fans. After all, Detective Conan: The Phantom of Baker Street is unarguably a very popular movie among them all and is often considered the best one in the whole series. To this day, I still don't necessarily agree with these opinions. That said, I can finally see why it is that people love this movie so much and why it is still worth recommending to this day. 
 
One of the things I found to be very fun about this movie is how it implemented the fiction of Arthur Conan Doyle into the world of 19th century London. The environments of industrial London are very well designed and the fan service for Sherlock fans is, admittedly, a pretty fun treat. The movie felt a lot more like an action-adventure story than the usual ""stay-in-one-place"" murder stories in most movies.  
 
One of the things that I originally didn't liked was the perpetrators motivation to trap all of the children under threat of death. Even now when I do understand what he really meant to do, it still feels kind of weird, ya know? You don't just go saying things like that only to reveal that you meant completely different. Among other criticisms, the fact that the whole movie takes place inside a game is pretty silly, I thought Yusako's case in the real world was basic(the fact that he had to wait for Conan to reveal the culprit's motive was contrived), most of the dialogue is pretty clumsy and hammy(e.g., the villain revealing his goal), and how there is barley any lack of tension when one of the characters gets offed in the game. 
 
My criticisms may look many, but I assure you that this movie is still quite good. If you just choose to let things be as they are and not worry too much about it, then The Phantom of Baker Street can still be a fun, good time.

Obvious clue of intrest can be told from the Movie's title, that the storyline will deal with Holmes. This asspect of the storyline for Detective Conan fans is a good thing, because if you know Conan/Shinji, you know that he is a major Conan Doyal fan. 
 
Also, there is the odd technollogy which does not exist yet, the virtual reality system. This is a change from most Detective Conan storylines as we are dealing with something that has not come into being yet. For the most part, new technollogies are introduced as possibilities when they become possibilities, so this adds an interesting effect. Even Dr. Asaga's inventions have some bases in current reality. 
 
Also, the story line is quite involved with the details of who when and why, the clues being dropped all throughout the virtual reality world. If one doesn't yet know about Sherlock Holmes, I do suggest learning somethings, as that would make the movie even more enjoyable then it is.

I happen to love how they handled the theory about the murderer and worked it into the plotline. Who is it and what did they do?

While I think most people would actually like this, I am thinking there might be some people who might have a problem with the truthfully non existant technollogy in here, but that, along with the Sherlock Holmes theme, helps to make this movie as great as it was.

No matter what physical or sexual abuse they deal, however, the girl regards her captors with the same apathetic expression. The next day, mangled bodies are discovered in that same building, so torn apart that investigators find it infeasible to even consider the culprit human. 
 
Elsewhere, a client request reaches Touko Aozaki's detective agency, tasking Shiki Ryougi with either capturing or killing the perpetrator of last night's incident. But soon, word spreads that a single survivor escaped the slaughter, and now the murderer is plowing down everything in their path to locate and exterminate him. A brutal race against time begins, pitting Shiki against a dangerous foe imperceptible even to her legendary eyes.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","
","In the third instalment of the Garden of Sinners series, we follow the story of Fujino, a victim of sexual violence that has gained the magical ability to twist and turn the body of other humans into abnormal positions, ultimately killing them. Her encounter with Kokutou brings the perspective back to the setting of the first movie with Kokutou, Touka and Shiki at the office. For some strange reason, perhaps because Kokutou came to her rescue like a knight in shining armour, Fujino tries to find him again, yet her threatening powers lead the question＃what does she really want to find him for? 
 
This movie focuses on the themes of revenge and justice and the way in which a person with similar attributes is treated, can lead to completely different outcomes. Though Fujino had similar powers to Shiki, her family never nurtured her or gave her respect, leading to her powers spiralling out of control. From events that occur, it can be deduced that it occurs after the second movie, but prior to the third. The side we see of Shiki leads us to believe that she has a much better control of her powers, yet we call her the absolutely moral character, because she herself has her own views on murder and the correctness of it based on the circumstances.  
 
Kokutou once again feels like he has a knack for running headfirst into trouble. Even though he knows that the people he＊s getting involved with have murderous intentions, he still believes that there＊s some good in them to be salvaged. He＊s portrayed as a super morally righteous guy as he even helps an escapee of Fujino＊s attack, one of the perpetrators of her assault. His relationship with Shiki is fleshed out further in this movie as Shiki gets entangled with the responsibility of subduing Fujino＊s attack, partially because Kokutou＊s life may be in danger. The very fact that she does her utmost to prevent Fujino＊s death as Kokutou was so desperately trying to do just goes to show how much she truly began to care for him.  
 
The animation of this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Fujino＊s power allows her to levitate and manipulate objects and the red and green colour of her eyes and her bursts of power looked pretty amazing. The showdown between Shiki and Fujino was certainly one to behold as it literally shook the hold city and left damage in it＊s wake. It also gave the opportunity for Shiki to act like her most badass self. 
 
Ultimately, this movie is about whether revenge is the better path to take in any situations. It also explores the nature that sometimes revenge is the only option, when hatred and pain is the only thing that＊s driving you. It really brings into perspective that when someone acts out and commits acts of inhumanity, to what degree should the people responsible for creating that monster have to pay for their own inhumanity? 
 
A pretty thought provoking movie with stunning visuals and extremely atmospheric soundtrack once again.

          
 
       Helpful The 3rd series of kara no kyoukai series or for watching in chronological its should be in episode 3..a story about a girl who doesn't feel any pain,set after a mere 2 month after the first movie take place,for this part viewer will experience or will saw human body been bend to many shape,humans part been torn aways and some gruesome murder,the story for this 3rd episode was can really be a predictability for certain events and the story was really makes sense in hindsight the story in here may initially for some event but that make the storytelling make it really interesting.. 
The art and the background there's not alot improvement in here its just how realistic that human body been torn and some gruesome murder was improved alot...for the character design and the environment its still in same nothing change alot... 
The sound and BMG still in their best part...its was enjoyed to listen for some scene.. 
Overall this's still an enjoyed to watching it with the action scene that will satisfied the viewers..

16,17187,72,4.704390497,Detective and his or her helper,Koukaku Kidoutai Arise: Ghost in the Shell - Border:1 Ghost Pain,"The anime's story is set in 2027, one year after the end of the fourth non-nuclear war. New Port City is still reeling from the war's aftermath when it suffers a bombing caused by a self-propelled mine. Then, a military member implicated in arms-dealing bribes is gunned down. 
 
During the investigation, Public Security Section's Daisuke Aramaki encounters Motoko Kusanagi, the cyborg wizard-level hacker assigned to the military's 501st Secret Unit. Batou, a man with the ""eye that does not sleep,"" suspects that Kusanagi is the one behind the bombing. The Niihama Prefectural Police detective Togusa is pursuing his own dual cases of the shooting death and a prostitute's murder. Motoko herself is being watched by the 501st Secret Unit's head Kurutsu and cyborg agents. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Mecha']","The series takes place in the year 2027, where many people in developed countries have become cyborgs with prosthetic bodies. Primarily set in the fictional Japanese Newport City, the series follows a younger Motoko Kusanagi before the formation of Public Security Section 9. At the start of Arise she is a member of the federal 501 Organization, a group who employs advanced infiltration tactics and espionage to attack or neutralize enemy threats. The 501 Organization is also the legal owner of Kusanagi's prosthetic body, which is lent to her in exchange for her services to the group. This debt displeases her and causes a disparity between herself and her employer.
","Disclaimer: As another reviewer said, splitting up the Arise-Border miniseries into separate parts is just silly. This will cover the entire thing. 
 
So what is Arise-Border? What should have been a straight-forward ""re-imagining"" of the cult classic turned international favorite strays all too quickly within the first few minutes. Instead of giving us a faithful ""re-telling"" with our characters being better-developed (a short-coming of SaC) and the story being old-news, Arise-Border seems to want to be something else while knowing it can't. So, basically the odd child in the family nobody knows what to do with. Just nurture them or something. 
 
Arise-Border is what I think the first part of the Arise ""retelling"" and it hits the ground stumbling. The first episode plods along uncertain of itself and how to invest its viewers while trying to tell the story of Makoto before she left her military unit to become an ""independent contractor"" aka join Section 9. My initial issue with Makoto in SaC was her being seemingly unstoppable, but still likable. This Makoto is so wonderfully incompetent it makes you wonder at points how anyone held her in high regard. 
 
Batou and Togusa are here, but the ""buddy cop"" relationship hasn't even had the seed planted yet. We do see a younger, stubborn Togusa (although his character hasn't changed that much, has it?) still green as a detective and instead of the highly-regarded guy any police force would want, he comes off as more the only guy who actually uses his brain on the force. Batou on the other hand feels like the perfect amount of goofy and ""big guy"" which saves the main trio. Thank the forces of nature, too, because the other members only exist to have a moment of exposure and then fade back into the background. 
 
I'll continue downing on the other stuff in a second, but I wanted to give the technical side of things some exposure. I mentioned in my SaC review that the music was fantastic and worth a listen; Arise-Border doesn't seem to know why. The opening is almost a lazy attempt at the beauty of Origa's voice mixed with some half-baked synth and I won't even go into the other stuff. I've said in another review that the music isn't what makes a series, but it can hurt it. Here, the absence of any music in some scenes is a Godsend. If a series doesn't know what its sound department is doing, leave the tracks that are supposed to stimulate the viewer as part of the whole, out.  
 
The art is good, but the designs that aren't set-pieces are okay. Some scenes really feel pleasing to the eyes while others (like episode 4's fight scene in the lab) are hard to watch if only because of how disjointed and out-of-place they feel. Thankfully, the series doesn't do this too often and when it does, you can take some comfort in knowing those scenes won't last long. 
 
The story itself is episodic and struggling to remain interconnected. The overarching plot is the ""Fire Starter"" virus that is affecting our post-modern military structure and causing false memories which lead to otherwise law-abiding persons to commit crimes. The first episode plays too much with the ""what is real?"" concept and loses sight before making a sharp U-turn back to the plot. The second episode does it better, but the last few minutes feel more like an attempt to recapture what SaC did right and run with it. Unfortunately, that ""out of place"" feeling comes back. 
 
The third episode is really good in that it takes advantage of having what the previous two set up and adding to the main plot. While nothing is actually resolved, there is development for the major. Unfortunately, the next episode shows a kind of unnatural regression for her character. Huh. 
 
Aramaki in this version is hard to watch. The cool, steely-eyed monkey-face is reduced to a begging old man chasing after a young body for her ""talent"". If I didn't know him to be the badass old guy from SaC, I would feel contempt for the character. Instead, this almost seems like a betrayal and the way he constantly demands Makoto and co join Section 9 is almost as painful to watch as the hard-headed major act like a bratty child who either gets her way or nobody can play with the ball.  
 
Arise-Border isn't a GitS series in the traditional sense. What should have been a creative re-telling is instead a lopsided building the engineers painted in bright colors and straight-faced told everyone it had ""personality"". Look at it, take a picture, but don't invest too much in it. 

          
 
       Helpful Do note that this review covers all four episodes of Ghost in the Shell Arise as a whole. That being said, on the review. 
 
Ghost in the Shell Arise is another spinoff of the Ghost in the Shell series franchise that bases its setting around the time that Section 9 officially formed and features the group tackling a series of crimes in each OVA episode that involve hacking of cyberbrains in some form. While maintaining the same themes of earlier Ghost in the Shell anime with corrupt political elements and debating the nature of one's humanity if they heavily convert their body into a machine, the different continuity leads to some interesting differences in character chemistry and personality. For instance, Motoko's more brash character leads her relationship with members of Section 9 to be different in comparison to earlier takes on the character as she is defiant of Aramaki's authority, will press Batou's buttons with her cyber-hacking skills and can usually find herself biting more than she can chew when dealing with cyberhacking threats due to inexperience in the field. Also, the time frame for the series is before Togusa's daughter was born which the series alludes to as he was still a police detective before joining Section 9 later in the series. Beyond this though, the majority of Section 9 get shafted in regards to any character focus as Arise is more focused on Motoko's perspective on any of the cases that she tackles. 
 
In regards to plot, Arise mostly focuses on the gradual formation of Section 9 through the different cyber-hacking crimes that they have to thwart. Each episode dabbles into the typical themes of the GitS franchise as I covered with Motoko and the remainder of Section 9 trying to figure out and resolve the threat from each case. While this exploration helps to attract Ghost in the Shell to more recent anime fans, all the cases that Section 9 tackle are self-contained in each episode and the lack of an ongoing plot like what Stand Alone Complex offered in the 2000s makes Arise lose a good deal of the intrigue and depth that came with Section 9 being challenged in handling cyberhacking crimes and questioning the state of their country's political and military system when uncovering more corrupt elements to both through the investigation of any cases they dabble into. 
 
Presentation-wise, Arise offers excellent visual quality as it sports highly detailed settings and character designs, notable examples being heavy mechs and Arise's version of the Tachikomas used as Stand Alone Complex's unofficial mascots. Movement is consistently fluid throughout the OVA's run as action sequences are nicely animated and net-diving scenes are just as much of a visual experience as they were from seeing Stand Alone Complex over a decade earlier. In regards to music, Arise chooses to utilize electronica tracks for many of its scenes and these clash rather poorly with the show's themes and action scenes due to their underwhelming mood. 
 
Overall, Ghost in the Shell Arise makes for a decent addition to the franchise as it offers some new takes on Motoko and the members of Section 9 while introducing its themes to new anime fans who got their start in the 2010s. The more episodic format of its storytelling does lead the majority of Section 9 to get shafted in focus and the lack of an ongoing plot may turn off those who enjoyed Stand Alone Complex. But with what it offers, it is still a good time-killer for action anime fans or diehard Ghost in the Shell fans. 

          
 
       Helpful it's been a while since we last saw the major and Public Security Section 9  
to long if if you ask me so you can imagine how excited i was when i first  
heard about ghost in the shell arise the The four part series that takes place 
years before the events of the first movie. 
 
in this series we get to see a whole new side to motoko kusanagi as a younger less self confident version of herself she's still displays the same stone cold demeanor that makes her such a good protagonist at the same time she also displays strong emotions mainly derived from her troubled past and childhood. 
 
without going into much detail and giving away spoilers the series takes place just as the major first meets aramaki and  Section 9 and begins to help them on a case they are working on. 
 
overall this first part of this four part OVA series is very well done although I may not  
like subd anime that much I can appreciate it for what it is it is well done addition to the ghost in the shell series with amazing sound the characters with no one love and the iconic cyberpunk and futuristic story that rivals that of many others.

""Minimum,"" or small miracles, are special powers that only selected people called ""Minimum Holders"" possess. The detective agency Yokohama Troubleshooting, or Hamatora for short, is composed of the ""Minimum Holder PI Duo,"" Nice and Murasaki. Their office is a lone table at Cafe Nowhere, where the pair and their coworkers await new clients. 
 
Suddenly, the jobs that they begin to receive seem to have strange connections to the serial killer whom their friend Art, a police officer, is searching for. The murder victims share a single similarity: they are all Minimum Holders. Nice and Murasaki, as holders themselves, are drawn to the case〞but what exactly is the link between Nice and the one who orchestrates it all? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Drama']","The story of Hamatora revolves around a 17-year-old teenager called Nice, who runs a private investigation agency called 'Hamatora' in Yokohama, Japan with his partners Hajime and later, Murasaki. In the world there is the existence of Select humans called Minimum Holders (立瓦穴丞石伙母奈, Minimamu Horud芋) have been discovered to possess supernatural abilities known as 'Minor Miracles' or 'The Minimum'. These people are trained in the Facultas Academy to develop their potential, and are given highly advanced classes and training to do so. As a result, those who graduate from Facultas are given extreme benefits and privileges that enable them to be highly successful in life, such as being entitled to any job or career they want with ease. The existence of minimums and minimum holders is kept extremely confidential and secretive from the general population of the world.
The events of Hamatora The Comic takes place in the year 2013, with Nice having left Falcutas Academy early in his senior year. Due to Nice both being a genius and a prodigy, Murasaki, the second highest ranked graduate from Falcutas, is tasked with the mission of bringing Nice back to Facultas by any means necessary. As Murasaki first meets Nice, his impressions of him leave Murasaki feeling insulted and angered that someone as easy going as Nice could be superior to him. As Murasaki observes Nice on his jobs though, Murasaki finds himself assisting Nice and comes to see the potential Nice actually possesses as well as acknowledging his genius. He also dwells on Nice's views on Facultas' workings and his opinion of how people with Minimums are not slaves and are free to live their lives responsibly.
Sayuri Akatasuki requests for Nice and Murasaki to rescue her sister Shizuku, a Minimum Holder who can generate fire, from a criminal family. Nice and Murasaki finish their job but Murasaki is tasked to leave Nice and to take Shizuku back to Facultas as part of the Academy's dark dealing with the mafia family. As Murasaki takes Shizuku to Facultas, Nice, Hajime and Sayuri are attacked by Facultas and the Hamatora office is destroyed. As Murasaki hands over Shizuku, he struggles on the decision he made and ends up trying to rescue Shizuku from Facultas. Nice, who managed to save himself, Hajime and Sayuri before defeating the Facultas agents, ends up saving Murasaki, but during the confrontation with Facultas and the mafia family, Shizuku apparently dies. In the week that follows, it is then revealed that Shizuku survived and faked her death so that she and Sayuri can live a new life without fearing her Minimum or Facultas and the Mafia family. Murasaki has since left Facultas and has joined Nice as a Hamatora P.I., which is now located in Cafe Nowhere along with Birthday and Ratio's 'Odd Jobs' Business and Honey and Three's Bodyguard business.
During the anime, Murasaki has joined Nice as a Hamatora P.I., where they prefer to sit around all day with their friends and wait for clients. During their Jobs, Nice finds similarities in the working of several crimes he investigates and the existence of non-innate Minimum Holders; people who possess a Minimum but were not born with it. Nice and Murasaki are warned by their friend, Art, a non-Minimum Holder who still managed to graduate from Facultas, about a Minimum Holder serial killer who extracts the brains to create more Minimum Holders.
The culprit is Moral, a former professor from the Facultas Academy who wishes to give everybody Minimums in order to achieve equality. For this, he has to kill several Minimum Holders and use their brains to create a substance he calls 'essence' that enables him to create 24 non-innate Minimum Holders for every Minimum Holder brain he possesses. While his overall purpose in this is to create equality, what Moral truly wants is to save Nice, as he believes that Nice is tortured by solitude as he is the number one student of Facultas, also calling him the accumulated wisdom of humanity, and therefore has no equal.
Moral kills Art and starts assuming his identity to dismiss Hamatora from the case. He starts a riot in order to expose the existence of Minimum Holders, and Momoka also leaks information exposing the existence of Facultas Academy and Minimum Holder identities, causing a disturbance in society as normal people treat Minimum Holders in a hostile manner, while Minimum Holders fight back to ensure their right to exist. After discovering Moral took Art's face, Nice confronts him in person to get revenge for his best friend's death. The two face off in a ship that Moral is using to perform terrorist attacks on non-Minimum Holders. As Nice defeats Moral, the murderer is killed by a resurrected Art. As revealed in Re: Hamatora, Art survived Moral's attack thanks to Regeneration Minimum, and has since been collecting new abilities. He becomes the leader of a gang called Freemum, composed of Minimum Holders who are against the Minimum Agency. Using Freemum and Momoka, Art succeeds in leaving Nice as his only potential enemy. He tries killing Nice to trigger Hajime's Nihilist Minimum, which erases all Minimums in Yokohama. Shortly afterwards, Nice is revived by the powers of Art's late brother, Skill (his heart had been transplanted by Moral years ago during an incident). As a result, the people in Yokohama recover their lost Minimums thanks to Skill's own power. Nice defeats Art, and six months later they reconcile.
","Hamatora aka the show with one thousand different opinions about it. 
 
The critcism has largely been about the direction the show took from an overall promising premise.  Hamatora is similar to the Yorozuya from Gintama, or a group of friends doing odd jobs.  That's about where the similarities end.  Hamatora is episodic at first, then kicks into high gear for the main arc. 
 
The first few episodes i really enjoyed, i loved the different jobs, mysteries, adventures the different groups experienced.  That's the kind of ride i like to be on.  It also does cheesy pretty well, and i'm a big sucker for cheesy.  And also badass OP characters that beat ass and take names. 
 
The main story might not float everyone's boat, while i thought it was Psycho-pass-esque in its plot, the delivery left something to be desired.  It's not that its bad, its more that its a bit different.  I did find it ultimately refreshing, but i'm not a fan of prolonged suspense, yet you couldn't even call it suspense.   
 
And that would be the major flaw IMO; the pacing was great, the art was lacking in a few places, the sound was all good, the characters were solid and most importantly fun to watch but.... 
 
the setting; or rather the environment, the feeling it gives off during the show just doesn't really fit.  It's jarring, it's hard to explain, you just have to watch it and find out if you dig it. 
 
Overall, i think it was a good ride, I would have liked to double the episodes to flesh out the characters and let the story simmer, but for 12 eps i think it did a pretty damn good job.

          
 
       Helpful This anime pissed me off so much. Because the plot was good and the characters awesome. But... but.. then they killed it. WITH THE AMOUNT OF FILLERS THEY PUT IN AND WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO EXPLAIN WTF HAPPENED AT THE END! I MEAN SERIOUSLY WTF! Now that my rant is over onto what I liked.I enjoyed how the main protagonists were not technically good. Yes they saved people and were technically heroes but they had a bit of a dark side to them which I enjoyed*. I liked the characters but there wasn't very much development with them. 
 
Now onto what I was saying about fillers. I'm sure other users have already said this but the anime was mainly made up of fillers. They was about two minutes of actual plot at maybe the end of one episode. If you had to work the plot into taking up a full episode there would probably be about 2 episodes. However I will say I'm watching the Re:Hamatora because there is a twist ending that will leave you thinking. What the fuck just happened. That is if you don't drop it.I 
 
I would not recommend this anime because it is amazing or awesome. But I do think people should at least try it out. Because its not completely bad just mediocre. 
 
*I'm mainly talking about Nice.

          
 
       Helpful Hamatora was an anime I wasn't interested in at first. The plot was not very original, and there seemed to be too many characters. But after watching it for a while, it became better.  
 
The art is unique and actual effort seems to be put in it (compared to other animes). The colors are flashy and eye-catching, which is something you don't see too often. The art, to me, is one of my favorite parts of the anime.  
 
However, the story was a bit lacking, and like I said, not very original. The whole 'people with superpowers' thing is common and easy. But the plot makes a huge turn and distances itself from other superhero animes, which I liked, but it wasn't enough.  
 
I think some characters are useless and a pain to have. For example, Hajime and Koneko don't really take action at all. Now, Hajime actually does pull her own weight, but only around the end. I get that there's a bit of symbolism, but that's all I really see. I'm hoping they'll all have a part in the second season, but so far, it doesn't appear so. At least, not for Koneko.  
 
Overall, I enjoyed quite a lot, despite all the little tweaks it needed here and there. I like that one of my favorite characters, Art, turned into a mysterious villain at the end. It was quite an unexpected twist. For me, at least. I can't wait to see what this anime has in store. I highly recommend it for everyone :).

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Demons', 'Supernatural']","The plot of the series revolves around three yokai (supernatural creatures), Bem, Bela and Belo, who arrive at a large coastal city and come across an evil atmosphere, which was brought about by immoral behavior by humans and mischief caused by monsters and yokai. They therefore decide to stay in the city, fighting against other monsters and yokai which attack humans, making a few friends along the way. Even though the three yokai are often abused and discriminated against by other human beings due to their appearance, they still strive in protecting the human populace of the city from other monsters, one day hoping to become human beings in return for their good actions.
","If you'd ask me that Bem was from a source that came out in the same period as the original comedic Dororo of the late 60s to early 70s, heck even the 2006 Studio Comet series, I would still scratch my head and ask: ""What is that?"" 
 
In any sense of the word, this series, like Dororo, is meant to celebrate its 50th anniversary by creating yet ANOTHER original anime about the demon humanoid characters Bem, Bela and Belo. Only the most faithful of people who like Range Murata's works would ever chance upon this show, whereas for anime-onlys like myself, can only drought in its mediocrity. 
 
However, unlike Dororo, where MAPPA and Tezuka Productions gave the 50th anniversary series a hella lot of love for such a big change that we know and love, Production I.G. and a new studio, LandQ, decided to cooperate in this project, where the stark comparisons in dedication can be awfully seen even with the naked eye. 
 
The story in a nutshell is that the demon humanoid trio of Bem, Bela and Belo, are trying to eliminate monsters from the world called Upper, and in the human world termed Outside, these monsters are wrecking the lives of humans, and to add some drama to it, detective Sonia Summers is on the call to find out the connection of the demons and the trio, who want to be acknowledged for their efforts and live another day, growing to be more like humans and hoping to be them. 
 
I don't know about you, but the episodic feel of the show really detriments it, not that it was a show to look out for, it was basically under the radar and it should stay that way. It isn't bad, but by no means it impress, by a very long shot. 
 
The only reason why I'm here is because of the OST. How on earth did we get such a jazzy OP with Maaya Sakamoto that sounds incredibly average is beyond me. JUNNA's ED is crazy soothing and splendid, what a great song. 
 
If you long for a Range Murata work, this is it after quite sometime. If not, pass this up.

          
 
       Helpful I didnt saw the original series or the 2006 remake so i had nothing to compare it. I saw this show with no expectations at all and i think that best way to watch it in an objective way. SPOILERS 
 
Story: The story is a mess... The show introduces 3 main characters Bem, Bela and Belo anthropomorfic monsters with the long to be humans that live in Libra City, a city that symbolize classism, and that summarize the whole show. The way that was written and directed are the main problem, the show tried to be a social criticism about the classism, humans being the real monsters and corruption in goverments. Because of that the anime doesnt explain a thing... we dont know the origin of the main trio, how they met, why they live in that city and the secondary characters like Sonia or Vega ""the main villain"" are only plot devices to continue the story. 
The final battle is rushed and the purpose of it didnt make any sense. I attribute all the to the low budget that the show had. (5/10) 
 
Art: Despite the low budget the anime doesnt abuse of the 3D animation, the action scenes are very fluid, the monster designs are very generic and without personality. (5/10) 
 
Sound: The only good thing about the show, the selection of jazzy jams for the OST and the opening were an excellent choice. The anime ending is a very good song as well (7/10) 
 
Characters: The anime doesnt explain anything of the main trio so we cant relate to them, their personality, decisions etc are only to make the story continue (3/10) 
 
BEM could have been a great anime but the director and the writter decisions combined with low budget made it a mediocre and forgettable anime. Overall the only thing retrievable about this anime is the OST and the OP/ED. (5/10) 


          
 
       Helpful Bem has a decent Plot that has potential. The Animation is very Poor and Lazy. This is one of those shows where it could have been good but the way it was done just killed it. The Art Style is Bland. The way the Fights are Animated is very disappointing. The Visuals and Fight execution are what makes this Anime look mediocre. It has a Nice Sounding opening that's Animated good and Unique but in the show, what you see is a far-cry from good. In some frames characters look decently rendered, and in other frames the quality of the characters make it seems as though they weren't even done drawing them on the screen. The Fights look as though whoever wrote this show completely forgot to factor in how their combat would look so they left it up to the Animation Team to come up with some quick ideas.

But this is what happened before any of this; the main character is getting ready for mercenary school (With guns, bullet proof vests, and all sorts of cool shit) while listening to his hormonal friend cry about everything the main character does or say making her instantly annoying (While the main character tries his best to keep a ""whatever man"" attitude), but she has big boobies and all is forgiven. 
Meanwhile a teacher at said school is giving out an introduction to a class about the school and mentioning a criminal who is out killing the students (The teacher really doesn't seem bothered by this so the adults in this anime probably don't give a shit). 
 
The anime then fast forwards back to where it left off and the two characters are in an awkward sexual position and the main freaks out and takes the chance to check out his companion who has issues with her bodily proportions whom also freaks out accordingly. 
But the antics come to a close as a pack of blood thirsty uzi segways starts to shoot up the place, but unfortunately for the segways the main character has the ability to abruptly swap out his character for a total badass who then, after chasing the segways away with CG animation gunfire, starts putting the moves on Aria who he thinks is a middle or elementary schooler (Who'd blame him? and creepy), but of course she's in high school (Obvious as hell)! 
 
After that the main character proceeds to school while nonchalantly explaining that his family genes is the reason he can swap to a more fun character to watch called ""Hysteria mode"" (Oh I see, it makes sense now, I guess?), then when he reaches his homeroom, Aria is there and everyone calls them lovers. 
 
Afterwards Aria moves in with him out of the blue, the end. 
 
My obnoxiously massive sarcasms aside, this anime has many routes it can go judging off the first episode, but many of those roads may cause a severe case of dejavu for many viewers who at this point couldn't care less about another ecchi or harem anime, but for those who don't know the tropes and cliches or feel comfortable watching familiar elements will most likely enjoy this anime the most.

REAL REVIEW 
 
*I'm spoiling a lot, but frankly, I don't give a f**k* 
 
What's popular isn't necessarily good, but what's good isn't necessarily popular, Aria painfully falls into the former. 
 
STORY: J C has made some of the most popular anime out there, Shakugan no Shana, Toradora, Azumanga Daioh, and Toaru Majutsu no Index are all great examples. So obviously they want to continue the trend train with another runaway hit, right? 
 
Well this is the good example of ""Animate whatever random light novel that's out there, no matter what it is,"" syndrome, which is now common for many animation studios. 
 
Too common for J C unfortunately, my guess would be that J C took one look at the titular character and thought, ""Hey, she's underdeveloped physically, she's flat chested, and has long hair! By god, she's like the last couple of girls we animated, and even the novels she's in are popular! Let's animate this!"" 
 
Well, let me put my syndrome in this way: it's kinda like the pokemon games, it gets staler and staler with each and every game, same ole same ole. 
Unlike the required updates for the pokemon games though, the anime J C puts out is lesser quality for this one, even Shana (An anime that's over 5 years old now) looks noticeably better than Aria, an anime that started in early-mid 2011, which anyone would easily be justified to call it lazy. 
 
But let's look at the story now, that always compensates any lack luster animation, right? 
 
Ehhh, it starts out being nothing special in the least, main male character starts to bond with Aria by doing small stuff like looking for a cat, or going on a date, though it was more babysitting than anything else. Though the male has his unique (Yet random) character trait that literally changes his entire character from typical main male lead who's just a tool for the ladies to mr suave lady killer bad ass, which is quite refreshing for that role... but he doesn't do it enough and just leaves you feeling more desired, though if it did happen more, the anime would just be a full on harem because he has to be (sexually) excited in order for it to happen. 
 
But the on going plot has to do with a criminal called the butei (Butei, sounds a lot like it's pronounced ""booty"" in english, obviously not a lot of thought was put into this name decision) killer, who arranges EVERY life or death situation like the movie ""Speed"" by hijacking vehicles from segways to planes and setting bombs all over the place, doing it once was good enough for people to smile at and say ""It's like that movie, that cool,"" but three more times? With each becoming more ridiculous than the last, like it's trying to out do it's self. 
 
Then the anime immediately train wreaks by episode 4. 
 
By that I mean character twists in that episode are embarrassingly ridiculous, one of the characters, the culprit (Who barely gets much screen time, that on top of her weak motives for doing the crimes) reveals that she is the descendant of Lupin, then reveals that Aria is the descendant of Sherlock Holmes 
 
Sherlock Holmes vs Lupin, let it sink it and just try to convince yourself that this doesn't sound stupid in the least. 
There was absolutely no sign of Aria's relation to Holmes. 100% completely out of the blue, and for no good reason for either character, with only Aria's middle initial and a silhouette of Sherlock himself in the opening animation as lazy hints clues, all the while it abruptly ends the first main story. 
It's such a bad twist that even M. Night Shyamalan himself would facepalm. 
 
And for some reason they start treating the whole thing like they solved an actual case... Seriously, at the end of episode 5 one of them says case solved out of no where, which was just damn stupid of them to say because the criminal reveals herself to them and even runs away as well, what the hell has been solved? My limit towards nonsensical bullshit? 
She could honestly continue to rip off that movie to still cause mayhem and just because they know who she is, doesn't mean they can stop it, she did it four time or more and she can continue to do it again without anything to worry about, another person could just take over for her because that way of hijacking doesn't look hard at all to pull off. 
 
And speaking of the culprit, she herself is the most ridiculous and nonsensical person of the whole bunch. 
From revealing secrets to just seemingly making up whatever bullshit she wants, it'll just make you groan with irritation. 
Not to mention that she performs feats of sheer nonsense, to using her hair as a weapon with no explanation until episodes later (Even the most mediocre shonen series would at least explain at the moment for whats happening in the context of it's world), to using her own clothes as a parachute. 
 
Ridiculous, typical, looks cheap, and rehash, I'm sure there's more words to describe the mediocre anime that is Hidan no Aria, but that's just enough for me. 
 
ANIMATION: The characters designs are really uninspired and just unfortunately are too similar to many of JC's past productions.  
To be honest, Aria looks exactly what would a cross between Shana of Shakugan no Shana and Taiga of Toradora would look like, just a shana with green hair. 
The animation is good, but not amazing, though I would be lying if I said the gun fights weren't exciting, but then again I've seen them done better (Little assassins, a famous outlaw, and an iconic hellish vampire comes to mind). 
During many of the gun fights, CG animation is used, but I'll leave that to subjective views. 
 
SOUND: The Tsundere queen repraises her role once again, and that's the only thing really noticeable, the opening is alright and ending sounds great, but leaves no impression. 
 
OVERALL:  
The Good: 
+ Decent animation, outside of the CG stuff I mean. 
 
Mixed: 
+/- Rie Kugimiya voicing another tsundere. 
 
The Bad: 
- Retarded plot. 
- Cliched like you wouldn't believe. 
- The whole cast of characters are nothing more than the generic rip offs that are generic rip offs. 
- Half the time the anime makes no sense. 
- Episode 4, seriously that episode is bad from start to finish. 
- Rehashes too many of it's plot devices. 
 
You really can't blame me for reading too far into the anime, and it is kinda entertaining in it's own way, well it's stupid as entertainment (You can play a nice drinking game for every stupid element to help you get through it). 
You can say it's a whole new Shakugan no Shana, but the story is just too incompetent to even make that statement, even Aria herself has no redeeming qualities. 
I'm sure they could've redone the story in a way that would make more sense, plenty of anime companies have done so, but this one is just an obvious cash in.

          
 
       Helpful If you can accept that high schoolers can legally run around with guns and katanas and do police work, you will find that the rest of the universe becomes rather plausible. However the mechanics sadly lack consistency. The show tends to treat Hysteria mode as a deus ex machina kind of feature. Most problems faced by the protagonist are solved through the power of his boner, which comes across as a hindrace for the character developement. This is especially true in his interactions with female characters. More often than not, conflicts and disagreements are solved by him going into HSS and the women melting away like wax in his hands. One can consider this as a integral part of the story but I did not come around feeling, that this often does not give the female characters the credit they deserve. 
 
The main protagonist has a trait called ""Hysteria Savant Syndrome"", which enables him to call upon enhanced strength, stamina and cognitive and coordinative abilities. It is activated by sexual arousal (of course) and thus a convenient in-universe explanation for the ridiculous amount of fanservice in this show. It enables him e.g. to avoid bullets and retaliate with extreme precision. The protagonist himself does not like the ability, because under its influence he becomes irresistible and behaves like Casanova, for which he is ashamed afterwards. As a consequence he is a loner that avoids women but by the law of Harem-Anime is inevitably swarmed by a estrogen tsunami of female characters. 
 
The characters are generally very stereotypical. The protagonists Harem consists of a loli tsundere, a childhood friend yandere, a villanous tease and many more. In the light novels we also find a mysterious kuudere, a sister, a trap, a dandere, a furry, an actual guy (hinted) and several older women. Mostly if you know the main clich谷 they play into there is almost nothing further to know. The yandere character will ALWAYS behave like a yandere under all circumstances and without exception. This soon renders the interactions calculable and hardly surprising, but if you like two girls catfighting over a guy with swords and pistols over and over again... 
 
The protagonist is not really an exception, so we are stuck with the usual dense, broody loser/loner type Harem-Protagonist. What sets him apart at least partially is his deeply cynical attitude. The one job that he does not want to do is that of a butei. The one job he happens to be actually good at is that of a butei. He is roped into the entire story by the female tsundere lead and constantly complains about the chaos happening around him. His snarkiness comes across mostly in the light novels and not at all in the anime. He acts very little on his own accord and is mostly dragged along by the other characters. This is somewhat justified as his role is that of Arias partner. 
 
The singular one most annyoing part of the show is by FAR the leading heroine: Aria Kanzaki. She is a childish, prideful and stubborn patchwork of all complexes known to mankind. She is as loud and abrasive as her behaviour is irritating. I do not generally dislike maniacs in leading roles, as long as they are interesting to some degree. Unfortunately in the same way as all characters Arias' behaviour is constrained to her tsundere role, so I couldn't help myself cracking a hearty smile when she got slapped. 
 
In conclusion the characters are mostly nothing special and fit a typical harem-anime. If you aren't tired yet of seeing the same clich谷s reiterated you could give it a shot. 
 
The humour is mostly based on the stereotypical behaviour of the cast and/or physical humour. If we were given a cent everytime the tsundere threatens to shoot people because she was embarassed, we'd be rich by the end. Of the first episode. 
The humour is one among many things that puts a stretch on the credibility of the universe. Two girls fighting and shooting at each other within a student dorm room and completely wrecking it in the process is somehow not punished at all. Opening fire at the protagonist in public because YOU drank from HIS cola is of course completely rational human behaviour. I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for a good joke, but it really went overboard at times. 
 
The fanservice belongs to the most annoying and reoccuring elements of the show. This kind of fanservice is the reason I lock the door when watching anime, despite the fact that I live alone. There are probably not many Rom-Com clich谷s the writers didn't pull here, from convenient falling, intruding the bathroom to accidentally discovering undergarments and indirect kisses (i.e. Drinking from another's drink) we must suffer through everything. A lot of the fanservice was mostly a cheap, awkward filler, and sometimes very uncalled for. Nonetheless there are scenes that, despite the shame- ,need-, use- and tasteless display of half-naked girls, actually contain story or (behold!) even character developement. 
 
The story follows a standard redemption plot, where the titular heroine tries to bail her falsely accused mother out prison. By the laws of her origin she needs to find a partner, which she believes to have found in the protagonist. The protagonist is soon recruited (by force) as her ""slave"" and dragged along various missions. 
 
Albeit predictable at times the story is surely interesting enough to keep watching, even though it becomes more and more absurd as the show continues. One might even continue just to see what kind of bullshit the author is pulling out of his ass next. (It's not better in the light novel. Rule Nr.1: As soon as magic enters, things go south.) 
 
My main problem with this show is, that the author is constantly sabotaging himself. There is so much potential buried in there, that is sacrificed to useless fanservice, stupid comedy and generic writing. The protagonists Hysteria Mode serves as an example. His main trigger for Hysteria mode (read: sexual arousal) is his partner Aria, who is underdeveloped in both body and mindset. If you consider, that the protagonist does not like ""what he does"" when under the influence of HSS, you could interpret this as him being a self-aware sexual predator and pedophile. This is a topic the story never deals with. Additionally there is so much more that could be made of the characters in this show. Instead of acting by themselves they fall into their stereotypical roles again and again, displaying the same kind of behaviour without any kind of developement. The problem is that I sometimes had the impression, that there was more to the characters, their actions, motives and intentions. It seemed as if they had a hidden depth, that the author would shy away to openly show. 
 
Riko Mine is a good example. One finds out that she is a very traumatized woman, that constructs her aggressively sexual personality as means to cope and survive. BUT this is just briefly mentioned and then never again, shoving her back into her role as the villanous tease. This constant self-sabotaging is just sad and discouraging to watch. I am not even sure if the author noticed the possibilities he created. Which is at least preferable to believing he willingly threw them away...

          
 
       Helpful SPOILERS INSIDE. 
 
This is not a show you love or hate. This is a show you＊re bound to regret watching. It＊s extremely clich谷d, mediocre quality and a money-maker, and above all 每 annoying. But so ridiculously it sometimes is amusing. 
 
Still, two things make this series for me: 
1.	Aria＊s hairpin which is sadly gone after a while, 
2.	Kinji＊s Hysteria Mode. 
 
Beyond that, there is not much to see here. But then again 每 what can you expect from a series that was already highly overrated by the Japanese fans even before it aired? I should probably have said otaku instead of Japanese fans, excuse me, but that＊s what happened, with this series being the most anticipated one of Spring 2011 season. Why, yes 每 in Japan. Don＊t they love Kugimiya. 
 
Story- and character-wise, what＊s in it? Tsundere (but not the likeable kind, the I-have-seen-this-how-many-times-now kind) female lead 每 check. Male protagonist being useless 95% of the time 每 check. Veeeeery unexpected plot twist in early part of the show 每 check. A bunch of supporting characters that are there just to try to fill us in on the backstory and still fail miserably 每 check. Great. The two protagonists attend a mostly ridiculous school where teenagers are trained to be detectives - or rather super agents - and so far the plot has been focusing on how cute Aria is. But she is not. She is another Taiga/Louise/Shana clone created just to please the fans. There are moments when she is bearable; yet that is mostly when she is not talking at all. And the Holmes crap? I thought Lupin the 4th was quite funny, but they had to add Holmes the 4th into it. Wow, just wow. UPDATE: they also tossed Jeanne d＊Arc in. I thought that nothing could surprise me anymore. 
 
And what about Kinji/Ry?ji? The 5% he＊s not useless is when in Hysteria Mode, which he is reluctant to enter because it makes him act retarded. In his opinion. It does not. 
 
In terms of visuals J.C. Staff did just reasonably. I like how the opening and ending sequences are animated, plus the fights - the fights are great eye candy. The rest is not something we have not seen yet. I＊m just quite surprised that they do not animate the protagonist loli particularly well. Low budget? No way. Laziness? More like it. Little can be said about the art of ※Hidan no Aria§. It＊s not bad, it＊s just nothing spectacular, and given how new anime can look, I＊d call it a tad disappointing. 
 
The sound is a different story. Good background music, that＊s certain; OP and ED, just fitting for this series, are average; but for once I must complain about the voice actors. Rie Kugimiya 每 if it was not for Kagura, she could disappear completely from the face of Earth. She does not create her characters. She IS them. Very, very disappointing. She brings nothing new into yet another show. I used to like her voice, but damn, isn＊t it annoying. Now it＊s just painful. Boring, too. Just remain Kagura, that＊s what you do well (and Taiga, for that matter). Going on with the list: Mariya Ise was a good Stocking, but performs just typically as Riko; Junji Majima is Ry?ji, end of story. 
 
Somehow I managed to watch the entire thing. SOMEHOW. The second half gets far worse than the first, which, frankly, is an achievement. Just do not watch it. At all. 
 
Very not recommended.

16,7662,76,4.67547187,Detective and his or her helper,Shinrei Tantei Yakumo,"Haruka Ozawa's sophomore year is getting seriously scary. One of her friends is possessed, another has committed suicide and Haruka could be the next one to flunk the still-breathing test. Her only way out of this potentially lethal dead end? Yakumo Saito, an enigmatic student born with a mysterious red eye that allows him to see and communicate with the dead. But the deceased don't always desist and some killers are more than ready to kill again to keep dead men from telling any more tales. That doesn't stop Haruka's knack for digging up buried secrets, and there's even more evidence of bodies being exhumed by both Yakumo's police contact and an investigative journalist with a newly made corpse in her closet! Can this pair of anything but normal paranormal detectives solve the ultimate dead case files or will they end up in cold storage themselves?  
 
(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']",none,"Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a shoujo series based on a series of light novels by Kaminaga Manabu. It's had two manga adaptations, the second of which is still going. In 2010 it got an anime adaptation from Bee Train. Not long ago we looked at their work with Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom and I've also looked at Murder Princess. So, they're two for two so far. Of course, this is the first thing I've reviewed from them where they weren't co-producing. Still, let's see if they can make it three for three and give me something good to close out the month.  
 
Story: 
 
Ozawa Haruka has a problem. After she and some friends went inside a forbidden building, one has committed suicide and another is in hospital, possessed by spirits. Haruka seeks out the help of Saitou Yakumo, a supposedly psychic boy at her University. Yakumo agrees saying that he can see spirits and might be able to persuade them to leave her friend. Over the course of that investigation, Haruka discovers that Yakumo can, indeed, see ghosts and that his left eye is actually red. From there, the two keep finding themselves involved in more mysteries involving spirits. Meanwhile, a shadow is closing in on them that's intimately connected with Yakumo's past. Can the two of them stay alive and find the truth?  
 
Let's start by discussing the weaknesses of the series. In this case, the big one is the mysteries themselves. Most of them have answers that are made really obvious to the audience through the use of really unsubtle hints or, in some cases, by the series actively showing you who's responsible. Which just leaves you to see how the characters are going to figure them out and makes the investigation portions a bit lacklustre. There's also the romance betwixt Haruka and Yakumo. While it does have some good moments here and there, it's also pretty static. Haruka develops an obvious crush on Yakumo really quickly and then the two of them hang out a lot, in spite of his seeming disinterest. From there, it moves at a really slow pace. There are some hints that he also has feelings for her, especially towards the end, but nothing gets done with it and, ultimately, it comes across as more of an excuse to keep her in the story than a serious attempt at writing romance. There are a couple moments that are a bit nonsensical too. For example, there's a scene where Haruka is in a car and its driver can't move. Rather than climbing over him to hit the brake, she just settles for steering. There aren't many moments like that, but the ones they have are really head-scratching.  
 
Let's move on to the positive factors of the series. The first is that the world is built really well and there are defined rules for what ghosts can and can't do. It's not one of those vague things where it bends and shifts based on plot convenience. The series is paced really well and it is interesting to see how the characters solve the mysteries even if the audience has already been handed the answer. The series is also good about showing the plot elements that it's going to use in the climax early on while using those elements in a way that it feels very unique and is actually compelling. Tension is used  effectively in the series and its portrayals of sexual assault are respectfully done. They're told through description rather than actually shown but they have a lot of weight to them and they're actually relevant to the story instead of being thrown in.  
 
Characters: 
 
The characters are well written. They have a good level of complexity and they do come across as actual people. Crazy people, in some cases, but not in an exaggerated or forced way. There are some really compelling dynamics in the series as well both friendly and antagonistic. On the down side, I will say that the way that Detective Gotou's character ultimately develops is a bit contrived.  
 
Art:  
 
Taken as a whole, the character designs and animation are quite good. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well and the supernatural effects are visually interesting. The biggest fault with the artwork is that, like they did in Phantom, Bee Train mistakes putting their animation at an odd angle for intensity. Showing someone slanted diagonally isn't more intense nor does it make the scene more dynamic, it's just annoying.  
 
Sound:  
 
This series has a strong cast. Ono Daisuke gives a strong performance in the leading role. Fujimura Ayumi does well as Haruka. Takase Akimitsu makes quite a villain. Touchi Hiroki is good and, I really have to give credit to Koshimizu Ami, the voice of the young deaf girl, Nao. She does an amazing job conveying the thoughts and emotions of a character who communicates entirely in grunts without a single line of actual dialogue. I knew she was a good actress from hearing her performances as Claes in Gunslinger Girl, Alita in Murder Princess and Holo the wise wolf, but this was a really difficult role and she aces it beyond what I would have expected. The music isn't as strong as the cast. It's all right but nothing that really grabs you.  
 
Ho-yay:  
 
There isn't any. The closest it gets is that there's a period where Gotou thinks his partner, Ishii, might be romantically attracted to him. This causes things to be awkward for a while as Gotou freaks out. I can't fault the series for lack of realism, since there are plenty of blokes who freak out about the idea that another bloke might be into them, but it's a pretty stupid reaction. Just tell him you aren't interested if he confesses. Chances are very high that he'll understand and accept it. It's not like you have to give him a good long snog just because he expresses interest.  
 
Final Thoughts:  
 
Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a solid series. It certainly has some issues that detract from it, but in spite of those it has a compelling narrative, strong characters, a great cast and good artwork. Overall, I rate this one a 7/10. It is a good series. Next week, I'll take a look at the final instalment of the Kara no Kyoukai films. Have a happy Halloween in the interim. 

          
 
       Helpful I will refer to the series being reviewed as Psychic Detective Yakumo. I watched this to try and alleviate my boredem. The synopsis will not be typed here for obvious reasons. This is just my opinion and attitude towards this series.  
 
This series is suppose to be a horror but I have no recollection of being scared, nervous, alarmed or even startled while watching Psychic Detective Yakumo. The ghosts were more of a joke than terrifying really. They come off as people's shadows . Could you please just for the sake of this review try to scare someone you know by standing still and asking them to look at your shadow whenever you have free time. The episodic structure of the show is a chance for this show to tell refreshing stories that improve on the previous episode, but it is the exact same formula over and over and over again. Girl asks psychic for help on a potential case, psychic insults girl, detective that the psychic helps and vice versa becomes involved in the case and the trio set off to solve the mystery. After a few episodes watching became more of a chore. There is no unpredictablity and the writing is just flat. How can I get rid of this ghost? Why don't I try the exact same method I used the previous week.  
 
The characters are complete strangers to the viewer with no real development. The only characters that I really cared for was detective Gotou and Isshhin Saito but they can't really save this series from being the exact oppisite the creators were trying to achieve. You will read about this in a lot of reviews but it's still a complaint from my side: The villian is a complete alien. You get that type of my kids should stay away from that guy whenever possible vibe but he does not live up to his full potetntial. His goals are never stated which means everytime the show cuts him you have to squeeze interest out of yourself to listen to something that may or may not have something to to do with the plot. If you hear what everybody calls him in the series you will realize exactly how uninteresting and stale this weirdo is. The romantic plot that that makes up alot of the show's ""story"" goes nowhere. I was really expecting something , anything. I have to listen to whining and arguing between two people I dont give a damn for for 13 episodes. Give me something,anything! 
 
The sound is run-of-the-mill voice acting with the exception of the most intersting characters Gotou and Isshhin. My cousin told me he realized that a lot of voice actors speak with a mono tones when they have to dub anime to english. This is the exact case with Yakumo. When he is supposedly shocked or sad yo just hear that mono tone (a lot like Edward's tone of voice from Twilight). The OP  is terrible. If you can classify under what type of music this falls under please let me know (I only listened to it for about 10 seconds).The ending theme was actually beautiful,it is that type of song you can understand without speaking the language it is performed in. 
 
The art was alright. It's not like Dragonball where everyone is drawn according to Asian sterotyping,you know that saying . These characters have looks that fit what liitle personality they have perfectly. The backgrounds are okay and the ghost are just ""meh"". 
 
The show was alright at the beginning but went to make my weekend feel a lot longer and declined after just 2 episodes. I have to admit I liked the ending, I'm a sucker for stuff like that and because the experience was over. Here's what I thought about the show: 
 
Pros: 
-Gotou and Isshhin 
-Ending theme   
-Ending 
-Art was alright 
 
Cons: 
- Everything else 
 
Story - 5/10 
Art 7/10 
Sound 6/10 
Character 5/10 
Enjoyment 5/10 
Overall 6/10 
 


          
 
       Helpful This series had so much potential.. The plot, the characters everything at first was very intriguing. But i dont know it never reached its full potential, and throughout the show it seemed like there was a key ingredient missing. I felt like the characters were really undeveloped in some ways. Overall the story plot was good, but I felt like it couldve been so much more. At best, this is the kind of series is something you would watch when you wanna kill time.

The art is about the only thing going for it. It's well made. Then again, what isn't these days?

The voices are ok. The op and ed are boring.

I have no idea what is going through the characters minds. The detective calls herself a NEET, but since she works as a detective, she is technically employed. Why did the protagonist join the yakuza? Are they yakuza? 
The behavior of the characters is confusing and nonsensical. Easily the low point of this show. 
 
Enjoyment: 5 
 
I was so confused I could not follow almost anything that was happening. I mean, following one episode was one thing, but I for a show with arcs, they did not play off each other very well. 
 
Overall: 5 
 
The show gets a 5 (Mediocre) for its overall score. Descent art is brought down with a lackluster story and poor character development. Not really worth the time.

          
 
       Helpful I can't say that i was looking forward for the ""next episode"". The way the plot starts and the way the story goes it makes you feel a bit bored. Only in a few occasions you find yourself interested but only when something is about to be revealed. From the characters only few have their own back-story, but not that many details. It's not an anime you are going to watch again but just another title on your list.

          
 
       Helpful Kamisama no Memo-chou or in simpler words, Heaven's Memo pad is basically about the NEET Detective agency led by Alice and revolves around the protagonist/narrator Narumi Fujushima, who is a high school boy. 
 
The investigation of the cases taken by Alice involve the other NEET Detective agency members and the leader of the Hirasaka gang along with the protagonist. As the series proceeds, more characters are introduced in the plot. 
 
The series starts with Narumi being dragged into the Gardening club of his school by a classmate(Ayaka) and eventually into the NEET Detective agency as Alice's assistant. 
 
Since the anime had something to do with a 'detective' agency, there was bound to be mystery involved in it. In the first few episodes, the viewers aren't provided with much information about the case, hence one cannot try to 'be the detective' in these episodes. However, with the plot involving a former member of the Hirasaka gang, the viewer is provided with enough information and I did spend a day trying to figure out what exactly must have happened(It turned out to be right after all :D). As the series enters into the last few episodes, it becomes a little boring and depressing. At least, I did not like the way it ended.  
 
Regarding the characters, the protagonist seems to be the biggest 'weakling' among all and the person h matches closest to would be Ikari Shinji(from Shin Seiki Evangelion). However, later on, he does get a sense of leadership thanks to a small sacrifice. 
As for Alice, she is a (super)hacker who is obsessed with Teddy bears and hates to go out. But one thing that I never understood was, how old is she anyway? That remains a mystery I guess. 
The members of the NEET detective agency only seem to be useful for getting more information for Alice from what is not available in the database and rescuing Narumi when he gets into hot waters. 
The leader of the Hirasaka gang, the Fourth and the former gang member Hirasaka Renji  were probably the best characters in the series from my point of view because they were the ones who were independent for the greater part of the anime. 
 
Overall, this anime got interesting after a few episodes but the excitement failed to keep rising and it got boring towards the end. That said, it was awesome for the greater part and did keep me excited about what would happen next. Once again, not as good as the other mystery genre animes I have seen, but definitely good enough to watch at least once.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space']","The series begins with Triplanetary, beginning two billion years before the present time and continuing into the near future. The universe has no life-forms aside from the ancient Arisians, and few planets besides the Arisians' native world. The peaceful Arisians have foregone physical skills in order to develop contemplative mental power. The underlying assumption for this series, based on theories of stellar evolution extant at the time of the books' writing, is that planets form only rarely, and therefore our First and Second Galaxies, with their many billions of planets, are unique.
The Eddorians, a dictatorial, power-hungry race, come into our universe from an alien space-time continuum after observing that our galaxy and a sister galaxy (the Second Galaxy) are passing through each other. This will result in the formation of billions of planets and the development of life upon some of them. Dominance over these life forms would offer the Eddorians an opportunity to satisfy their lust for power and control.
Although the Eddorians have developed mental powers almost equal to those of the Arisians, they rely instead for the most part on physical power, which came to be exercised on their behalf by a hierarchy of underling races. They see the many races in the universe, with which the Arisians were intending to build a peaceful civilization, as fodder for their power-drive.
The Arisians detect the Eddorians' invasion of our universe and realize that they are too evenly matched for either to destroy the other without being destroyed themselves. The Eddorians do not detect the Arisians, who begin a covert breeding program on every world that can produce intelligent life, with particular emphasis on the four planets Earth (Tellus), Velantia III, Rigel IV, and Palain VII, in the hope of creating a race that is capable of destroying the Eddorians.
Triplanetary incorporates the early history of that breeding program on Earth, illustrated with the lives of several warriors and soldiers, from ancient times to the discovery of the first interstellar space drive. It adds an additional short novel (originally published with the Triplanetary name) which is transitional to the novel First Lensman. It details some of the interactions and natures of two distinct breeding lines, one bearing some variant of the name ""Kinnison"", and another distinguished by possessing ""red-bronze-auburn hair and gold-flecked, tawny eyes"". The two lines do not co-mingle until the Arisian breeding plan brings them together.
The second book, First Lensman, concerns the early formation of the Galactic Patrol and the first Lens, given to First Lensman Virgil Samms of ""Tellus"" (Earth). Samms and Roderick Kinnison are members of the two breeding lines and they are both natural leaders, intelligent, forceful, and capable. The Arisians make it known that if Samms, the head of the Triplanetary Service, visits the Arisian planetary system he will be given the tool he needs to build the Galactic Patrol. That tool is the Lens. The Arisians further promise him that no entity unworthy of the Lens will ever be permitted to wear it, but that he and his successors will have to discover for themselves most of its abilities.
The Lens gives its wearer a variety of mental capabilities, including those needed to enforce the law on alien planets, and to bridge the communication gap between different life-forms. It can provide mind-reading and telepathic abilities. It cannot be worn by anyone other than its owner, will kill any other wearer, and even a brief touch is extremely painful.
Using the Lens as a means to test mental qualities and identify individuals able to help him, Virgil Samms visits races and species in other star systems, recruiting the best of them and forming the nucleus of a Galactic Patrol. Their opponents are discovered to be a widespread civilization based on dominance hierarchies and using organized crime to assume control of new planets.
The series contains some of the largest-scale space battles ever written. Entire worlds are almost casually destroyed. Huge fleets of spaceships fight bloody wars of attrition. Alien races of two galaxies sort themselves into the allied, Lens-bearing adherents of ""Civilization"" and the enemy ""Boskone"".
Centuries pass, and eventually the final generations of the breeding program are born. On each of the four ""best"" planets, a single individual realizes the limits of his Arisian training and perceives the need to return to seek ""second stage"" training, which it is later shown to include the ability to slay by mental force alone; a ""sense of perception"" which allows seeing by direct awareness without the use of the visual sense; the ability to control minds undetectably, including the ability to alter memories untraceably; the ability to perfectly split attention in order to perform multiple tasks with simultaneous focus on each; and the ability to better integrate their minds for superior thinking.
As the breeding program nears its conclusion, humans are selected as the best choice; at the same time, the breeding programs of the other three planets are terminated, and their penultimates never meet their planned mates. Kimball Kinnison meets and marries the product of the complementary human breeding program, Clarissa MacDougall. She is a beautiful, curvaceous, red-haired nurse, who eventually becomes the first human female to receive her own Lens. Their children, a boy and two pairs of fraternal twin sisters, grow up to be the five Children of the Lens. In their breeding, ""almost every strain of weakness in humanity is finally removed"". They are born already possessing the powers taught to second-stage Lensmen. They are the only beings of Civilization ever to see Arisia as it truly is and the only individuals developed over all the existence of billions of years able finally to penetrate the Eddorians' defense screens.
After undergoing advanced training, they are described as ""third-stage"" Lensmen, transcending humanity with mental scope and perceptions impossible for any normal person. Although newly adult, they are now expected to be more competent than the Arisians and to develop their own techniques and abilities ""about which we [the Arisians] know nothing"".
The key discovery comes when they try mind-merging. They discover they can merge their minds to effectively form one mental entity called the Unit. The Arisians describe this as the ""most nearly perfect creation the universe has ever seen"" and state that they, who created it, are themselves almost entirely ignorant of its powers.
The Children of the Lens, together with the mental power of unknown millions of Lensmen of the Galactic Patrol, constitute the Arisians' intended means to destroy the Eddorians and make the universe safe for Civilization. The Galactic Patrol, summoned to work together in this way for the first time, contains billions of beings who in total can generate immense mental force. The Arisians add their own tremendous mental force to this. The Unit focuses the accumulated power onto one tiny point of the Eddorians' shields. The Eddorian shields are destroyed along with the Eddorian High Council. It is stated that this was the only thing the Arisians could not have done by themselves, but without its accomplishment the Eddorians would have eventually turned the tide and beaten the Arisians.
The Arisians remove themselves from the Cosmos in order to leave the Children of the Lens uninhibited in their future as the new guardians of Civilization.

This mid 80∩s film has aged pretty well, excepting the CGI which was laughable (though not as laughable as Golgo 13.)

       Helpful Lensman (1984)  
 
[img]http://www.world-art.ru/animation/img/1000/464/1.jpg[/img] 
 
1984 brought many sci-fi oriented stories. One of which was Lensman, directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Memories, X) and Shinya Ohira (Gundam sequels, Akira), so there is some strength here. Unfortunately, the script is weak, the music is pretty much absent, and the voice acting (Japanese and English dub) is sub-par at best. 
 
The story is about a farm boy named Kimball whom dreams of life bigger than is country lifestyle. Well, it just so happens that an intergalactic war is going on simply between good and evil. During some battle somewhere, Kimball comes across a runaway spaceship, finds an important guy, and gets this glass-thing called a ※lens§ transferred onto him. The backstory of the lens is weird and does not seem to make much sense. All that＊s important is the lens contains important information on it, and must be taken to the good side. Don＊t let the dark side have it, as the dark side will aim to kill you.  
 
Just at first glance watching this, the amount of Star Wars references is astounding. It gets to the point where it might as well be an animated spin-off of it. There is even some incredibly lame CG just thrown in places really just distracting from the above average art style. Whether or not the CG was amazing at the time, in post 2000＊s, the CG should not even be there in the first place. 
 
In the end, Lensman has one decent chase scene in a rail car, of sorts, at just past the mid-point in the movie. Unless you are pining for a sub-par anime that is a desperate attempt to hit at the Star Wars hype, Lensman is hardly worth anyone＊s time watching.

          
 
       Helpful First, some education.  Even though this was made in 1984, the source material was published in 1939.  For those that can do simple maths, you should also be able to tell this is 38 years before Star Wars.  So whom borrowed from whom?  Unfortunately, the movie is only loosely based on the source material, and the author, E. E. Smith, completely distanced himself from this movie and the 25 episode series. 
 
Also, there are technically THREE versions of Lensman.  There is the original Harmony Gold dub from 1988 that was edited, the Streamline dub from 1990 that was unedited (about 18 minutes longer), AND a completely different version called The Secret of the Lens.  The Secret of the Lens is technically the first four episodes from the series sort of mashed together.  The Streamline dub is has the superior voice acting, but many favor the Harmony Gold dub for its electronica. 
 
This movie is one of the jewels left to us before Streamline dissolved along side Robot Carnival, Wicked City, and Lily CAT to name a few.  The animation is slick and crisp, the audio is on point, music is placed exactly where it needs to be, and the story is about a kid who gets some powers and kicks an intergalactic despot's ass.  What's not to like?

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"SHORT 1 - Final Flight of Osiris (dir. Andy Jones and prod. SQUARE USA) 
So, this short only really exists to set up Matrix Reloaded as well as Enter the Matrix (greeeaaaattt), and in spite of a well choreographed opening fight scene, it quickly devolves into gray mush with muzzle flashes. It suffers slightly from Star Wars prequel-itis, yes it is tying directly into events of the film I like and yes I do recognise the iconography, but the reason these shorts exist is to expand the universe beyond what was seen before. FFoO meanwhile does very little to expand the universe, stylistically ressembles a Matrix themed Second Life server, and is a boring slog to begin with. This short should've been called The Blue Pill because it sure as hell put me to sleep. 
2/10 
 
SHORT 2 - The Second Renaissance Parts 1 & 2 (dir. Mahir Maeda and prod. Studio4oC) 
Now this is where we should have started, detailing the conception and subsequent rise of machines, it's an interesting expansion of this world. The visuals are interesting with overall fine designs, the main focus are the machines and they look great, but the humans all look very bland bar a few close up shots with some interesting shots with a portrayal of them being extremely animalistic. It's also one of the more intense and mature execution of the robot uprising idea, with neither the message of ""human bad"" nor ""technology bad"" it shows the conflict without bias with both sides being given a part to flesh (or metal) out their motives. 
7/10 
 
SHORT 3 - Kid's Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oc) 
Whilst The Second Renaissance showed a larger conflict as whole, this short shows the personal stakes of a Neo-like character living in the Matrix whilst questioning his reality. The sketchy visuals with the fluid almost jittery movements is an amazing portrayal of the characters perception of the Matrix. Although an extremely simple short it's effective in its execution with a brilliant soundtrack to couple some interesting animation and it really does a good job at justifying this collection's existence as a whole since it and the previous short have already displayed the diversity of Matrix as an IP. 
9/10 
 
SHORT 4 - Program (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri and prod. Madhouse) 
Kid's Story was more about animation in motion, meanwhile Program is extremely picturesque and beautiful with a further exploration of small scale conflicts found within the resistance groups, it was extremely effective in both tying familiar iconography with unique ideas, the use  of paper doors as an obstacle was a cool moment, the simulations bleeding code was very nice, and overall the samurai setting is a brilliant set up that gives this short its own identity. 
8/10 
 
SHORT 5 - World Record (dir. Yoshiaki Kawajiri and prod. Madhouse) 
And it's a sports anime now, no but seriously as expected from Madhouse it's got some amazing animation, my main description would be ""Redline - except my car broke down"" and you can really see those aesthetics in this short almost 4 years prior. It's an interesting addition to this collection and also a very unique spin on a sports story like this, I probably would've preferred if Matrix Reloaded was about this guy instead. My only real complaint is it's placement, we just got a Kawajiri/ Madhouse short, so it somewhat nullifies the complete variety displayed prior, that being said the style is still different enough with more exaggerated faces as well as a larger emphasis on  movement and a more naturalistic environment that breaks into some unique visuals in the sequence with the Smiths (Agents, not Morissey). 
7/10 
 
SHORT 6 - Beyond (dir. Kouji Morimoto and prod. Studio4oC) 
It wasn't at all surprising when I checked Morimoto's page and spotted Tekkon Kinkreet inhabiting his body of work, this is definitely my second favourite stylistically and in motion it's an absolute treat. I see why Thor: Dark World directly ripped this scene into their movie (yeah Marvel, I fucking noticed). There isn't really much else to analyse with this short, I adore the aesthetic, it fully utilises it's format as a short to tell a concise yet realised story. 
10/10 
 
SHORT 7 - A Detective Story (dir. Shinichiro Watanabe and prod. Studio4oC) 
Watanabe is back and hey look, it's my favourite! I love how it blends the Matrix universe with a film noir/ manga aesthetic, it was definitely a smart choice putting this towards the end seeing as it seems to tie directly into the films somewhat with the appearance of main character (okay, yeah Neo and Trinity showed up in Kid's Story, but Trinity is like the central focus). The writing is sharp, the soundtrack is amazing and the mystery while small is still very fun. My only complaint is it seems t be cut a tad short, but when my complaint is that I want more, that's not really a complaint. I would love to see Watanabe do a detective series sometime since this style very much suits him. 
10/10 
 
SHORT 8 -Matriculated (dir. Peter Chung and prod. DNA) 
I was awaiting a short to explore the spirituality of Matrix, sadly they saved it for last, conceptually the short has interesting themes with the humans somewhat reprogramming a machine by making it feel like a human almost. Aesthetically in its backgrounds it is gorgeous and the sequence wherein they explore this weird space within the machine is rife with Buddhist imagery and interesting ways of bending the reality. Aside from that, this short is ugly as sin, the awful proportions, the nauseating use of CGI that just doesn't meld well with the rest of the scene and good lord the outside world is so mind-numbingly dull, sadly we visit there often. 
5/10 
 
IN CONCLUSION: If the first and last shorts were cut, this would be amazing, but with those two bad apples I would say this is just pretty great, I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to just about anyone, but not without a ""skip the first short and the last short, they kinda suck"" prefacing it. Definitely a perfect companion for the Matrix and a much preferable addition to the series than Reloaded or Revolution.

          
 
       Helpful I＊m not a big fan of The Matrix trilogy, one of the more mainstream science fiction spectacles of the past twenty years. When I was a kid, I loved it. It was my first R-rated movie, it was dark and edgy like any kid is bound to like, and it had neat martial arts action. But as I grew older I finally watched the second and third films and began to hate the series. Anymore, probably thirteen or so years after watching The Matrix for the first time, I think it＊s overrated and I can＊t see the appeal. It hasn＊t aged well and that, on top of pretty bad storytelling as the movies continued, led me to neglect the series for years＃ 
 
Until now. I never watched the Animatrix, I don＊t think I had any intention to after Revolutions. So now, years later, allow me to break down the pieces that comprise the Animatrix and tell you which are good and which are bad. 
 
Final Flight of the Osiris-Written by the Wachowski brothers and animated by Square, this nine minute segment looks like the opening cutscene of a PS2 game. It starts with an entirely pointless fight where two characters cut the clothes off each other. They are suddenly pulled out of the simulation as Sentinels are chasing down their ship in the real world. What follows is a six minute sequence ending in a climax that isn＊t satisfying, nor really matters. This entire short is nothing more than an introduction to the style of The Matrix rather than pulling us in early on. The writing is lame, the CG is very dated, and you＊ll find nothing of value here. 
 
The Second Renaissance Part I-The second short details events before The Matrix, namely the divide between humans and machines. What you＊ll find here is an interesting background story about humans and machines having a schism that leads to animosity and violence. The machines build their own nation, wind up creating better technologies and having more valuable currency, which doesn＊t make humanity happy at all. This is all visualized stunningly, with many disturbing images as well as copies of real life historical moments such as the tank running a robot down a la Tienanmen Square. A fan of the movies will enjoy this history lesson. 
 
The Second Renaissance Part II-While containing some of the fantastic visuals of part one, part two is a lot less compelling. The humans put a dome around the Earth so the machines can＊t operate on solar power leading to a war that ends with the machines realizing they can harvest energy from human brains. Thus the Matrix was born. This part was pretty stupid. While the first part set up the idea of a smart science fiction story, the second reveals how ridiculous the plot of the series really is and how much the Wachowski＊s love to ruin good ideas with nonsense. If you watched the first part, watch the second, but be forewarned, it＊s stupid. 
 
Kid＊s Story-The first visually appealing short from an artistic standpoint, Kid＊s Story is directed by my biggest adversary in the directing world, Shinichiro Watanabe. A high school kid realizes he＊s inside of the Matrix, leading to agents coming after him while Neo guides him toward escape. While not the most impressive in plot, the animation is gorgeous. For style alone, I＊d suggest this segment. It＊s the best of the bunch. 
 
Program-A shorter piece, this one is another visual feast that concentrates on two people fighting over ideologies in a feudal Japanese setting. The action here is crisp, the dialogue is pretty smart, but it, penultimately, doesn＊t matter. I feel that to have a good short here, you need a beginning, middle, and end, not just a singular idea that doesn＊t go anywhere. Program is nice, but I still don＊t see how this is enriching me any further in the world of The Matrix. 
 
World Record-Here is the story of an Olympic racer who runs so fast he breaks the Matrix while some agents go after him to keep him locked within the program. That＊s it. The animation isn＊t that great, the story isn＊t exciting, and I think this may have been the weakest segment so far. 
 
Beyond-A pretty good short about a group of kids discovering a glitchy area in their town and exploiting the glitches for fun. While again not telling a compelling story this one does give us an idea of the process that is gone through to repair problems in the Matrix. It has good animation and ideas, but it＊s an otherwise unremarkable piece. 
 
A Detective Story-Another piece from Shinichiro Watanabe, this one is a noir adventure about a detective who is recruited to track down the hacker known as Trinity. From the outset you can see and hear the style (of course, very typical of Watanabe). This one＊s a good short with an actual plot, neat design, and it ties into the movies, making it feel more relevant. 
 
Natriculated-This one is made by the people who gave us Aeon Flux and is another eh on my part. It＊s got the trademark style of Flux but I wasn＊t impressed by the story nor did I find it to be exciting in any regard. As a finale, it＊s weak. 
 
The Animatrix is a very mixed bag. There are a couple of notable segments but it＊s just about as underwhelming as the actual Matrix movies. If you＊re a fan of the movie series, then you＊ll find some enjoyment here, but if not it＊s an  lame grab bag of great talents producing mostly half-assed shorts.

          
 
       Helpful The first Matrix is in my opinion one of the best science fiction films ever made and a real masterpiece. The follow up Reloaded is very flawed but still enjoyable. Revolutions on the other hand is just an awful ending to the trilogy. After watching the trilogy again I decided it was finally time to watch The Animatrix which I had heard very positive things about. The Animatrix consists of nine different shorts set in the Matrix universe (two of which are a two part story) the rest are not related. They are done by different directors and studios which gives all the shorts their own unique feel. The first short ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is CG and the rest are traditional animation. The directors who were involved are: Andy Jones, Mahiro Maeda, Shinichir身 Watanabe, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, K身ji Morimoto and Peter Chung. While all the short films are not on the same level of quality I will say there was not one that I found I didn't enjoy. The first short was perhaps my least favorite and even it was okay. What I love about these shorts is how they add and expand upon the ideas of the Matrix universe. The two part short The Second Renaissance Part details how exactly the world became taken over by machines and why it is in the state it is in the Matrix films. Another short details how Kid from The Matrix Reloaded was brought out of the Matrix. Grading individual categories for this would be difficult as the shorts are all in different styles but I will say I really enjoyed all of them. The Animatrix isn't perfect however and there are some issues I had with it. The first short could've been expanded upon a bit more so it didn't feel like filler. Also some of the characters could've been fleshed out a bit more even though these are all shorts some definitely had better characters than others. There is also the short called Program which started out excellent but the ending ruined the themes of it for me.  
 
Overall as a fan of The Matrix I really enjoyed this film and felt it had a great place in the universe. I do however recommend watching the Matrix trilogy before this as it you'll be able to see the ties this has to it.

From scene one it's hard to tell who the main character is, there is a protagonist but the screen time is divided between his sidekicks and the bad guys as well so there are lots of characters which gets needlessly confusing. To make it worse most of them aren't really interesting or important. 
 
At the 1st half the story is shallow yet fun, the bad guys want to kidnap the hero's girl and the good guys try to protect her. her memory was long erased and the movie starts with her believing the hero, her ex lover, is her father and he plays along with it. this was an interesting story line which disappointingly didn't reach a climax to wrap it up. 
 
The last act of the story is incredibly scattered and lacks of reason, just one big wtf full of deus ex machina and there are maybe 4 ""final boss"" fights. It gets to a point, several times indeed, that is laughably weird and effortlessly explained. 
 
The over all production was actually fine, I love the art and coloring of characters and locations, character design of both good and bad guys were nice, the animation is good and also the music had a nice trashy 80s feel to it to fit the cyberpunk mood.

          
 
       Helpful Even as an 80s nostalfag I really couldnt get into this. Its trainwreck, really. Its like they took every bad cliche of the time and threw it in a pot and this came out. Plot is all over the place and the soundtrack is really bad. They also repeat the same tracks too much for a 90 minute movie. 
 
Also, way too many flashback scenes. Again, this is a fucking 90 minute movie. We dont need this. 
 
It does have some pretty colorful psychedellic scenes though, and the first car chase sequence was pretty cool. 
 
But franky, only watch this if you have OCD about seeing every 80s cyberpunk movie/ovas out there. If not, stay away 
 


          
 
       Helpful I read the manga version many many years ago.....since then I forgot the name of that already, I tried to search without a clue for long.  Once in a while, I came across with this anime version and recognized the plot and the characters.  Thanks to the awesome Internet (and MyAnimeList), I could finally put my long-time search to an end. 
 
This anime version is somehow different than the manga version, and I am not going to include so here. 
 
And I want to say that, this Ai City anime kind of makes me like the bad guys more than the good guys, which is a rare case to me. 
 
Despite the fact that Ai City was made in the 1980's, there were some revolutionary sci-fi ideas being added to make this a unique classic. 
 
Lastly, I just want to mention again that, I was able to retrieve the manga name of Ai City, all because of my discovery of this anime version.

Searching for the scientist Dr. Laughton, suspected to violate human rights by trading organs, the Japanese detective Shunsaku Ban and his nephew Kenichi arrive at Metropolis. In the scientist's laboratory, Kenichi discovers a girl without any memory of her past life. He decides to help her, so they run away together. His uncle follows him and penetrates the dark secrets of the city to find Duke Red, the man ruling from the shadows. Meanwhile, Kenichi desperately tries to protect the mysterious girl from the people hunting her. However, Duke Red and his adoptive son have their own deep reasons for chasing the girl. These reasons are connected to her true identity and the struggle for the domination of Metropolis... 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Police', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Humans and robots coexist in the multi-layered city of Metropolis, although robots are discriminated against and segregated to the lowest levels of the city. Most humans in Metropolis are unemployed and impoverished, with many blaming robots for taking their jobs.
Duke Red, Metropolis＊s unofficial ruler and wealthiest citizen, has recently completed construction of The Ziggurat, a massive skyscraper which he claims will allow mankind to extend its power across the planet. A wayward robot disrupts the Ziggurat's opening ceremony, prompting Duke Red's adopted son Rock, the leader of an anti-robot paramilitary organization known as the Marduks, to shoot it down. Meanwhile, private detective Shunsaku Ban and his young nephew/assistant Kenichi Shikishima have traveled from Japan to Metropolis to apprehend rogue scientist Dr. Laughton, wanted for organ trafficking and human rights violations. Unbeknownst to Shunsaku, Duke Red has hired Dr. Laughton to secretly build a highly advanced android, modeled and named after his deceased daughter Tima, with the intention of using her as the central control unit for a powerful superweapon hidden at the top of the Ziggurat. Duke Red's plans are disrupted however when Rock learns of Tima's existence, and fearing for his father's safety, shoots Laughton and sets his laboratory ablaze.
Discovering the burning laboratory, Shunsaku locates the dying Laughton, who directs Shunsaku to a notebook containing his research. Meanwhile, Kenichi stumbles upon the newly activated Tima. The two fall into the sewers and are separated from Shunsaku. While Shunsaku searches for his nephew, Kenichi and Tima search for a way back up to the street level. They grow close as Kenichi teaches Tima how to speak, both unaware that she is a robot. Learning that Tima survived the lab's destruction, Rock and his subordinates hunt them relentlessly. The pair encounter a group of unemployed human laborers who stage an armed revolution against Metropolis's leaders and robot workers.
Unhappy with the Duke's popularity and influence, the president and the mayor of Metropolis try to use the revolution to overthrow Red and regain control of Metropolis. However, the president's top military commander, General Kusai Skunk is revealed to be one of Red's subordinates and assassinates them both. Red then imposes martial law and violently suppresses the revolution. In the aftermath, Kenichi reunites with Shunsaku, but Rock, who exposes Tima as a robot, wounds him. Red disowns Rock and removes him from command of the Marduks for attempting to kill Tima before taking her and Kenichi away to the Ziggurat.
Still determined to eliminate her and regain his father's affection, Rock kidnaps and deactivates Tima, who is now confused about her identity. Having tracked Rock, Shunsaku recovers Tima, and following instructions from Laughton's notebook, reactivates her. The two discover Kenichi is being held in the Ziggurat, but Duke Red and the Marduks capture them while the pair are en route. They are brought to the top of the Ziggurat, where Tima confronts Duke Red about whether she is a human or a robot. Duke Red tells her she is ""superhuman"" and destined to rule the world from her 'throne', the control system for the Ziggurat's superweapon. Disguised as one of the Ziggurat's maids, Rock shoots Tima in the shoulder, exposing her internal circuitry.
Horrified by her true identity, Tima goes insane, causing her implanted military protocols to take control. She proceeds to physically integrate with the throne and orders a biological and nuclear attack on humanity as punishment for abusing and discriminating against robots. While the others flee, Kenichi tries to reason with Tima. Robots all across Metropolis, drawn by Tima's command, assault the Ziggurat and attack Duke Red and his forces. Not wanting ""filthy robots"" to kill his father, Rock triggers an overload in the superweapon, killing himself and Red in a massive explosion. As the Ziggurat starts to collapse around them, Kenichi finally reaches Tima and separates her from the throne. Still in a confused state, Tima tries to kill Kenichi, but falls off the tower in the struggle. Out of love for her, Kenichi tries to save Tima and pull her up using one of the cables still grafted to her arm. As the cable begins to fray, Tima remembers the time Kenichi taught her language and asks Kenichi, ""Who am I?"", before the cable snaps and she falls to her presumed death. The Ziggurat collapses, destroying a large part of Metropolis.
Afterwards, Kenichi searches the ruins and discovers a group of robots have salvaged some of Tima's parts in an effort to rebuild her. While Shunsaku and many other human survivors are evacuated, Kenichi chooses to remain behind to help the survivors rebuild. A photograph shown during the end credits reveals Kenichi opened a robot workshop, named after him and Tima.
","Well, for an adaptation of the classic silent movie by Fritz Lang, this movie hit the spot right on. 
 
The story, while being way different from the original one, still takes place in the same city but with more mature subjects. 
 
The soundtrack and voice acting are great, but not perfect (some voices are a little too quiet). 
 
The animation, in one word: gorgeous! 
 
Overall, if I had to compare these two versions, both are worthy of deserving a gold medal, but personally I would give it to the 1927 version. Why? Because I re-saw this movie in concert in a cathedral two years ago with an organ improvising on this marvel, and boy was it transcendent! Now that doesn't mean the anime version of 2001 is inferior: both version are good in many aspects, it's just that my heart leans toward the 1927 version.

          
 
       Helpful An ambitious movie but with poor pacing. 
 
The story＊s pacing is not great. The first few minutes were really good, it showed the utopian world very well. Unfortunately after that the pacing was really slow, it just started introducing the characters, and all the side characters seem boring, the uncle, Kenchi, Tina, the villian, and it was really slow. The two main characters Kenchi and Tina are interesting though. The places explored by Kenchi and Tina were shown really well and the new zones in metropolis are shown in great detail. 
 
THe second half was amazing, there＊s a surprising moment I won＊t spoil. Then the pace moved faster and Tina starts struggling with her identity, which was really interesting, and it was fascinating watching how she dealt with this. 
 
The story was good, and the themes questions what does it mean to be human is shown very well. A highly ambitious movie with great world building, but poor pacing in the first half. 
 
Constructive feedback is appreciated :) 

          
 
       Helpful Metropolis displays a fairly standard cyberpunk story mixed with jazz music and has the look and feel of an early 20th century scifi. 
 
Story: In an age where robots are omnipresent and discriminated against, a mad scientist creates a new perfect being destinated to rule the world.... *yawns*. The story was simplistic, rushed, highly predictible (I could figure out everything in advance...) and with almost 0 character development. It is also very slow paced and could have fit in half the time. If you want an anime that keeps you on your toes, this is not the one. At least the story makes sense and flows fairly well, so it's watchable. 
 
Art: Lots of eye candy which is the main reason I kept watching it to the end. 
 
Sound: Well you gotta love jazz, I personnally think the music didnt fit at all. 
 
Character: It's very unfocused, does not make me feel they spent a lot of time on character design... 
 
Enjoyment: This is very slow paced for no reason at all. 
 
Overall: Very underwhelmed for something so highly recommended, I give it a 6/10 just because of the eye candy.

The government is shattered by their inability to act, and the police are left frantically searching for ways to crack down the perpetrators. The public are clueless〞until, six months later, a strange video makes its way onto the internet. In it, two teenage boys who identify themselves only as ""Sphinx"" directly challenge the police, threatening to cause destruction and mayhem across Tokyo. Unable to stop the mass panic quickly spreading through the city and desperate for any leads in their investigation, the police struggle to act effectively against these terrorists, with Detective Kenjirou Shibazaki caught in the middle of it all.

Great characters too, and the voices from the Detective and Nine, pf... fantastic 
I really wanted to see more of this anime, now im in love with him and im so satisfied with the end 
Very recommendable guys, trust me, you will not regret 
 


          
 
       Helpful Story: This show's greatest strength is how it unravels the truth behind Nine and Twelve's intentions. We begin with a setting in modern day Tokyo where 2 boys make off with what we know to be a heavily guarded and secured object. You can tell that moments up until revealing the protagonists' mission were paced very well up until the very end. The story writers did a damn good job of setting up each of the events, and making sure that we as the audience knew enough to know what was going on, but not give us the entire explanation just yet. 9/10 
 
Art: It seems that ZnT was going for a more realistic approach to its animation, which I found to add more to the story. The colors used and the graphic style paired well with the kind of mood that (I believe) the anime is going for, which is on more of a serious and darker tone. I understand that a psychological thriller probably wouldn't focus a lot on aesthetically pleasing aspects such as the hair color or backgrounds like most animations do. What I enjoyed was their use of feathers to off balance a lot of the psychological aspects of the anime. 8/10 
 
Sound: I really like the opening theme and found that it greatly captures the feel of the animation. The lyrics of the song also sets up the mood of the anime quite well. I also really enjoyed the voice acting in the main characters and felt like they were chosen very appropriately. I also look forward to more of Saito Soma's work in a future  with him voicing Twelve and Tatsumi from AgK, who have very different personalities and characteristics, very we'll. I retract a point due to the ""Engrish"" that was spoken throughout the show. I thought that the sloppiness of it took away from the sense of hostility and excitement that the producers want us to feel during intense scenes. 8/10 
 
Character: I consider the unveiling of Nine and Twelve's past to part of their character development because it allows us to understand why they have done the things they've done and chose the choices they've made. I also enjoy that Nine and Twelve have made an enemy of themselves in order to unveil who the true enemies are. Talk about a double negative creating a positive. The inclusion of Risa in their affairs didn't particularly draw out to her development, but more so to our protagonists instead. I would have liked to see her character play a stronger role, where she was not in need to always being saved or taken rare of by Twelve. 8/10 
 
Enjoyment: I very much enjoyed it. The beginning, where clues and riddles were being laid out was a great way to entice the us viewers to keep watching and anticipating for me. The tragic moments highlight how well thought out the plot was, and the final scenes made me feel sad, but at peace at the same time. 8/10 
 
Overall: Great psychological thriller! I enjoyed how much research and realism that was put into this anime. I think it's pretty daring to put out an anime about terrorism considering all the current events happening lately, damn, Zankyou no Terror carried the task very well. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something interesting to watch that shoujo and slice of life can't give to their viewers. 8/10

          
 
       Helpful Having watched this based solely on a recommendation I didn't hold high hopes and thought I would give 1 episode a try. I now sit here 6 hours later having finished the anime trying to find words that do it justice. 
 
We all have that one day in our lives that we lived, that felt real and will be remembered, it may not have been a big day such as a wedding but could have been as simple as a day off work or the perfect date. This is exactly what Zankyou no Terror feels like. It doesn't rely on one big shock factor to seal the deal it paces everything perfectly, leaving you satisfied, not wanting more or less. every element did their part to bring this masterpiece together. While it may not contain a big twist or shock factor it feels like a show that has been shown love and affection by the animators. 
 
Each and every character feels like they are reaching out to the audience, the story feels real and the soundtrack reaches right into your heart. The message is constant throughout and changes as the narrative progresses, leaving you asking ""if you had the chance, could you do it?"". 
 
I was on the edge of my seat the whole time with this anime, it was as though I was a part of it and for once I'm not upset that a journey has come to an end. Rather I feel better having seen it and knowing I can do it justice through recommending it to others.  
 
I don't think there will be an anime that will immerse me as much as this one did.

After being kicked out of his orphanage, Atsushi stops the suicide of a detective named Osamu Dazai believing he was drowning in the river. During his interactions with Dazai, Atsushi learns he is gifted with a supernatural ability capable of transforming him into a berserker white tiger in the moonlight; this made the orphanage torture him and kick him out in the past. Dazai recruits him into the Agency and there he meets many other ability users as they tackle various cases and events taking place within the city of Yokohama, a place teeming with individuals with Supernatural Abilities. Atsushi becomes the target of the Port Mafia member Ry迂nosuke Akutagawa, as there is a bounty on his head on the black market.
During Atsushi's fights against the mafia, he also meets Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald, the leader of the Fellowship of the Guild who placed the bounty on his head. Fitzgerald reveals there is a supernatural book capable of changing reality linked with Atsushi's tiger, hence putting a bounty on the black market. Fitzgerald disregards any superficial damage the Guild might bring to Yokohama in exchange for the book, having an airship named ""Moby Dick"" destroy the city.

","Ah, shit here we go again, another season with the masivelly overrated show. This time it＊s Bungou stray dogs. If you＊re watching the third season of it, you probably know what＊s this about, but if you don＊t, then to summarize main characters are part of the Armed Detective Agency, the organization with detectives, who have magic abilieties also the main baddies are members of the Port Mafia. 
The story begins with a back story of a Chuuya Nakahara, and the fan favorite Dazai-san. It wasn＊t espacially bad, but it was pointless, it basically added nothing. Chuuya beraly even reapeared later this season, not mentioning his previous organization, which he apparently was a member of, wasn＊t spoke of even once. Also I was very dissapointed with Ougai and the scene when he kills previous chief, it should＊ve been a forshadowing to some events later, but nothing like that happened. This whole backstory was absolutely pointless, because if you introduce something in the beginning of the season it should＊ve made significant role In the end, but it didn＊t. I know that anime must do what manga does, but realy you should've animate this backstory when it will be relevant to what＊s happening In the story. 
 
Then the next episode introduced us to the main Villain of the season: Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who was held captive by the Port Mafia in hope to recruit him as a member, win with him a game of poker, where if Fyodor wins, he＊ll be free, and if Mafia wins he＊ll work for them. Fyodor wins by tricking the opponents, and walk＊s out free. It was actually good the best episode of the season, but next 2 episodes are basically a filler, and the 7th episode was rushed. Also the main plot starts in the 8th episode! That＊s still not as Bad as 2nd season of Kekkai Sensen, but still. 
The main plot revelves around the conflict between Detective Agancy, and Port Mafia, created by Fyodor, where each side must kill the boss of other to save their own. His goal is to eradicate every person with some kind of ability In the town, but he wasn＊t able to do by himself, so why not make others do that. I guess it＊s kinda clever, but it＊s so much cliche!  But you know what＊s even more cliche? *Inhales deeply* MAKE THOSE TWO CONFLICTED SIDES CREATE AN ALLIANCE, TO DEFEAT THE TRUE BAD GUY!!! Also I love the scene In 9th episode, where one of the characters jumps into explotion, being like 3 meters away, he doesn＊t gets injured, but the whole ceilling does! OF COURSE, LOGIC!  
The conclusion was rushed, and instead of big battle with Fyodor, we've got big battle with his assistant, who did nothing earlier, if he was even introduced! Also why would Fitzgerald help the Detective Agency catch Fyodor, they ware his enemys not so long ago, the whole 7th episode was to show how he was crushed after the defeat in the 2nd season, but now their friends like nothing happened. Of Course! 
So In summary the story is very incosistent, cliche, and with many plot holes. Main plot is starting to late and it＊s below avarege. 
 
Everyone has their own tastes, so some people may like the cast here, or not. I actually dislike them, although Fyodor is kinda ok, also one of the good things in Bungou Stray Dogs, are character dysigns, and how stylish they are. But nobody can argue with me that there＊s no character development along the main cast. The author attempts to develop Kunikida, but at the end of the day, he behaves, like nothing happend. 
 
The Visuals were actually the best part this season. Through the most part it was good, and I adore the graphics in the op and ed. 
 
The music was solid but nothing spectacular, it was better In 2nd season. 
 
Without unnecessary draging, I didn＊t enjoy that. Too many plot holes and cliches, for me it＊s hard to enjoy something like this * says giving 9 to Kekkai Sensen*. Generally I don＊t like this show, most of the parts I just watch on higher speed becase I＊m not able to enjoy them. Then somebody asks ※so why are you even watching this?§, because moments like the backstory in 2nd  season, reminds me thet this still can be a very good show, but the writer is too lazy too write a good, and deeply written characters, which he showed he can do in the 2nd season. But I＊m not judging anybady for liking this show, enjoy what you want.

We finally got some back story on Chuuya and Dazai and its just so good. I really loved the new character and his ability. I just can't wait for the next episode there are so many possible things that can happen that are crossing my mind, I just can't express it. The art is on point just like every other season. I really hope they keep the quality for the rest of the season, but I probably don't have to worry about that considering their work until now.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']",none,"Alright, B:The Beginning is right off the bat one of the anime underdogs of this season. It coming out with all episodes doesn't help its case either cus at least from what I know ppl, including me, like to keep up with airing shows rather than watch complete ones and binge. 
 
However, this anime totally deserves more recognition! While definitely not the cream of the crop this season, it most surely is an above average watch and I enjoyed it a lot. Buuut there are flaws in this, flaws that kinda leave me hesitant to finish the show due to fear of it ending badly or with important questions being left unanswered.  
 
8/10 Setting: The setting in this anime is unorthodox, it's set in a sci fi age but in a medieval-like and modern culturural society. This in of itself is pretty neat, and I like the vibes the setting gives off what with the sci fi and fantasy intermixed. Best of both worlds in a nutshell. However so far not much is said about how and why the world works, which is fine, good anime don't have to flesh everything out word for word (ex. Girls last tour). But I feel as if something is missing in its worldbuilding, I am not set in stone, or immersed in the world as fully as I would be like in the world of Darling in the Franxx. 
 
10/10 Characters: The characters and interactions in this show are one of the best I've seen in anime. Truly amazing. The comedy is actually funny and it makes use of different methods in presenting it. It balances the anime trope of exaggeration, which we all know and love, with subtle humor which is just as hilarious (ex. Chicken gumbo scene in ep.10; Lily's car). 
The characters are not just varied in personality but in age too. There are lots of anime out there that does this but at the same time there are more which sacrifice the story and overall execution just for good looking characters and popular stereotypical personalities. The characters bounce off each other just right, not sacrificing realistic, relatable comedy/interactions that is well built up to, in place of plain slapstick humor. 
 
6/10 Story: The story in this show is pretty complicated due to the three perspectives we get and the hidden ulterior motives behind each ones. The story as a whole completely disregards the actual world its set place in. B: forms and progresses its story while disregarding the lore of the world and how it works. In result you get a weirdly bad/good executed anime b/c it does good on the stuff if works on but has an F for the things it disregards because it's still an important part of the whole. The whole story with Koku is additionally not executed and fleshed out right and not enough either. It lacks creativity and sensibility. The timing in which they introduce his story is also not well paced. Koku is a MC, but that's not what it feels like. His entire story development is messy and feels rushed due to him being finally properly introduced at like ep. 6.  I feel nothing for Koku and his motives etc... But am more attached to the RIS cast because of obvious reason. This is not good because the entire show revolves around Koku and his story, but because this was not executed right the rest of the show, which was executed properly, suffers and falls alongside it. 
 
TL;DR: 
B:The Beginning is an above average watch which I am currently enjoying a lot. This is due to its amazing cast of characters and their interactions with each other, as well as their daily life and the overall mystery/crime/action direction it takes. However, it has noticeable flaws and its story execution suffers from 50% good 50% bad.  
This show honestly would have been better off without Koku's side of the story/perspective and the whole demigod thing. A RIS focused story with a seinen,mystery,and action directed plot in a sci fi fantasy world would have been IMO the way to go.  
 
This anime mainly suffers from Overcomplication, which in turn bred a poorly fleshed out and developed 2nd part of the story due to it shining light on a lot of features in that section of the story but in a rushed manner and it uses this poorly put together story and makes it the center point by having the 1st half revolve around it. Which unfortunately brings the 1st half down with the second as a whole. 
 
EDIT: (Finished watching all 12 episodes)  
 
Wow... They actually let Koku and Yuna live... This anime is legit confirmed to have no balls whatsoever. The fact that no one died from the things they were obviously supposed to die from is pitifully laughable.  
 
Story is decent, characters and setting are phenomenal, but... 
 
Dear God the Koku and Yuna crap is horrible. Not an inch of good development for them and the ending was so cheesey and syerotypical. Was rooting for Minatsuki the entire time, that's how uninterested I was with this show's second MC, Koku and friends. This show is an example when shows have a bad MC, and sacrifice execution and good plot for crappy drama and Disney aspects.  
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Death Note, Ghost in the Shell, Psycho Pass and ACCA 13 are all interesting police/mysteries that I have fondly enjoyed and I wondered whether B: The Beginning would repeat the same success like these have. It's great to say that it's another one to add to the list. 
 
Story (8/10) 
 
The story takes place on the island nation of Cremona, where a series of intense and strange murders have been happening. They have been caused by the criminal known as Killer B and only the RIS legendary detective can figure it out. 
What makes B: The Beginning pretty different compared to most anime's I've seen is, it feels like it's juggling two stories at once and trying to tie them together. One of them is a police/mystery drama that concentrates on Keith Flick and the RIS, while the other story concentrates on Koku's mysterious powers and supernaturality.  
It concentrates mainly on the police/mystery during the first half while subtly having Koku's story in the background, I enjoyed how each episode got more intense as the RIS were trying to figure out how to stop more of the big crimes from happening like when the whole building was held hostage and had gas canisters hidden inside, which considering most of our RIS characters were in the building made the situation incredibly suspenseful. 
My interest in the anime kept growing every episode as Keith and the others kept hitting brick walls or had more problems coming out of nowhere to hinder their progress, until we reached the halfway point. This is where the story decides to concentrate on Koku for a while as we see his past and why he is hunting down these other supernatural beings, it actually creates an interesting mythos to the islands history. Then once you enter the final episodes, it felt kinda obvious that this needed to be longer than 12 episodes, maybe 15 at most, because the story struggles a little to balance the two stories and making them connect. Instead it concentrates a lot more on Keith and the horrors from his past as they finally find out who the main villain is, while on Koku's side it just has him trying to defeat the other main villain and saving his apparent girlfriend. 
I will admit the way it ended for Keith and the RIS side of the story, it was very satisfying and made me wonder how it would affect their characters. Whereas I was a little disappointed with how Koku's part of the story ended, it just didn't feel resolved which looking at what happened in the after credit scene proves there could be a season 2 for this very thing. 
 
Characters (9/10) 
 
In just 12 episodes B: The Beginning had to mess around with a large amount of characters ranging from the RIS, the villains and the main characters, for the most part it actually worked. 
 
Keith Tucker is the legendary detective of the RIS, who despite his grumpy and intelligent status is a bit of an unlucky as from time to time he ends up getting knocked into something or falls into something. This made him a bit of comedic relief which lessened a little as the story went on and as the situation got more and more serious. Even though he wasn't the happiest of characters you couldn't help, but support the dude throughout the whole thing and even feel a little sad for him as he doesn't technically win in the end as he faced a dilemma that would've ended badly in some way. 
Koku is the other main character, who has supernatural abilities like flight and arms that can turn into swords. He's a pretty quiet fellow and keeps to himself mostly as he has one goal in mind, to find Yuna. This makes his character fairly straightforward, but you still support him nonetheless since he is the good guy, he just gets overshadowed by Keith who has a much more interesting personality. Although Koku is a badass in his own terms and definitely suffers the most out of all the characters and you do feel a little more for his character once you know a little more about his history. 
Lily Hoshina is Koku's older sister whose family adopted him, she is part of the RIS and strangely reminds me of Mika from Psycho Pass. However unlike Mika, Lily is a likeable character, sure she shouts and tends to put on a mood quite often, but her actions and reasons are always in the right place. Plus she is surprisingly smart, almost to Keith's levels of deduction which made her a strong character. She also tended to be the more comedic relief than Keith was, I mean the small cars she drove looked pretty hilarious. 
There was a huge amount of supporting characters ranging from the other RIS members and the villains. The other RIS members were all quite likeable and had great chemistry when they were working together, even if the atmosphere wasn't friendly at times. The villains on the other felt a little wasted, true the main villains like Ross and Minatsuki were threatening and interesting characters, but I feel like the others were kinda wasted. Some did have a bit of a spotlight, whilst others just got killed off pretty quickly. I will admit though it must've been difficult having to juggle around so many characters in just 12 episodes. 
 
Art (9/10) 
 
Now I will credit for B: The Beginning being set somewhere else, yet I find it funny how the name Cremona is actually the name of a city in Italy. It definitely has the dark tone most of the other police/mystery anime's have although it still makes sure it's a bright island nation between all the action so it isn't all doom and gloom. 
The character design also reminded me a lot of Psycho Pass especially Lily and Keith's look, hell Lily looked a lot like Mika from Season 2 and luckily she didn't turn out as dislikeable as her. 
I also liked how expansive the islands were, since it wasn't just one big island it was actually a chain of islands together and there is actually quite a bit of interesting history like where Koku and the other kids were brought up added a huge amount of mythos to the islands. 
It also had a 1950's Caribbean feel to it as well, since most of the cars looked like they were from that era, although the fact that the cars were CGI didn't mix too well with everything else. 
 
Sound (9/10) 
 
It was quite disappointing to see that there wasn't really much to the op as it was over in about 10 seconds so there really isn't much to say, however the ED from B: The Beginning is definitely the best ED of 2018 so far, because it had the right feeling for an anime like this and definitely had Psycho Pass vibes as well. It starts off slow until it reaches a certain beat and continues to escalate until the very end, which was really fun to listen to each time an episode ended, helped by the cliffhangers of course. 
The soundtrack was also great to listen to, the action scenes had some really thrilling stuff that would also get pretty emotional sometimes especially during the final episodes when all hell starts to break lose, but there was also a bit of a fun beat whenever we had downtime moments with the RIS crew as they try to solve the mystery on front of them. 
 
Extras: 
 
As a Police/Mystery type anime it definitely nails it, the whole situation between finding Killer B and stopping the range of highly dangerous crimes that have appeared out of nowhere kept me on edge, when Koku's story came in the mystery element had been split in two, with one focusing on Keith's past and the current crime going on and the other focusing on Koku's destiny because of the power he holds and this kinda got jumbled up a little by the end. 
The action was really good, ranging from the quick and intense fights that Koku had with the other villains that were like him to the drawn out gunfights and car chases that the RIS encountered, but most of the action moments were mainly in Koku's side of the story since Keith and the others were using most of their time to figure who is the main villain and why they are doing this. 
Psycho Pass and Death Note had strong psychological focus in their shows, here it isn't as strong or intense, but it really starts to pick up in the final episodes especially when Keith confronts Ross, who has been trying to hold back his insanity by secretly murdering people and mutilating their bodies underneath the RIS HQ which is pretty messed up. 
 
Enjoyment (9/10) 
 
This was a very enjoyable anime, it gives us a lot on our plates yet it mostly manages to make it balance out in the end. 
 
Overall (9/10) 
 
Overall this was another nice addition to add to my great Police/mystery anime list and hopefully there is a season 2 as some story points didn't feel finished so maybe one day a season 2 might happen.

          
 
       Helpful B THE BEGINNING ANIME REVIEW 
 
OVERALL: 9.6 
 
PLOT: 9/10 
 
I'm searching for a series with an initial of letter B when my eye caught this one. At first, I'm quite unsure if I want to watch it since the protagonist guy looks weird. But at the same time, it also looks cool. Episode 1 give me the creeps. Like woah, I really didn't expect that. There's an aura of Zankyou no Terror on this one. The kind of genre I've been searching for. The story will keep you going. The mysteries that will make you press the next episode. The questions left unanswered up until the ending. Well, the place where one of the protagonist came from is quite common. It's kind of the escape on how unbelievable characters are made. But on the whole, it's exciting, really. This series conveyed how twisted mind of human works. How it can manipulate someone's thinking. How it can lead to something inhumane.  
 
CHARACTERS: 10/10 
 
I love the craziness of the characters. Insanity is something a normal human cannot understand. It's something human think is inhumane. It's a sin, a grave mistake, but that's why the story keeps going. It's the level of their foolishness to do something they want to. The characters conflicting beliefs made them stand on each others' way. Their remorse in the past which pushes them to step forward is something a human is very known of.  
 
SOUND AND ANIMATION: 9/10 
 
I don't really like the animation at first since the protagonist is something like a weird old guy. But along the way, the characters are definitely good looking. Apart from the fact that the characters are way too cool, by cool I mean really really cool, their expression is also not to be discarded. It flawlessly show the expression the characters need to portray. The excitement, the agony, the hesitation, the disagreement of things will also reflect on their faces. There's really no opening song but the ending one seems to heavy. It feels as if someone is drowning and no one can save him coz he don't want to be save. It's depressing.  
 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10 
 
Since the first episode, I knew I'll really enjoy this series. 12 episodes are really short if you are having fun watching it. Every scenarios keep my eyes hungry for more. It's not everyday that I can see an anime like this one. A perfect mix of pyschology, gore, mystery. I think it's also an action and supernatural one.  
 
ENDING: 10/10 
 
Is dying means losing? Is living means winning? The ending is such an intense one. Watching the protagonist do things that against his will, that you know is wrong but still he do it. In the end, it's not the question of living and dying. It's more than that. It's standing on your ground, etching your beliefs to someone else's mind. It's a good ending and there's more to come. I just hope I won't wait too long.

But a detective agency specializing in paranormal occurrences notices that there are a few glaring, disturbing similarities tying the deceptively unrelated cases together: All the victims are schoolgirls, and all of them have jumped to their deaths from atop the ancient Fujou Building, a skyscraper that is scheduled to be bulldozed soon. 
 
To investigate the cause of these disturbing events, the head of the agency, magus Touko Aozaki, dispatches Mikiya Kokutou and Shiki Ryougi. The kind and surprisingly normal Mikiya serves as a stark contrast to the cold and mysterious Shiki, who possesses the ""Mystic Eyes of Death Perception"": an abnormal ability which allows her to see, and bring, an end to all things.

","Ufotable's beautiful use of digital lighting effects, the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura at her best, and dialogue consisting of philosophical musings come together to create probably my favorite atmosphere of anything I've ever watched. The story is something like a dream, which means it was simple and yet confusing with unexplained supernatural occurrences, but that's perfect for this film. Such was the power of this film that it had me enthralled to watch someone eat a container of ice cream in silence.  
 
To me, this forms a pair of aesthetic polar opposites with My Neighbor Totoro. Whereas I loved Totoro for its natural style depicting energetic, lifelike children exploring a vibrant, forested rural area that reminds me of where I grew up, I loved this film's hazy, decaying cityscape rendered in heavily stylized light and color, inhabited by pensive adults. 
 
After Sam Watches Anime's youtube analysis has been watched, it becomes apparent that the point of the film is that the risk of gaining a broader perspective is losing one's own place in the world, and therefore oneself.

          
 
       Helpful Movie or TV? 
 
I can easily see this being one or the most frequent question regarding this Anime. The purpose that the creators decided for movie is very likely because they did not want to follow the regular TV episode release date system (one episode per week), and thought that if they split it in movies, they could perfectly split them in Arcs. Personally, I would prefer TV, though, because it would make it easier to review than reviewing an alonestanding movie where it is barely possible to consider certain aspects, such as the character development. On the other hand, it is a good possibility to consider how all the Arcs were done when they are separate. Still, if I had to decide, I would definitely go for TV. It would perfectly fit as a 22 episodes Anime. 
 
For a short movie like this with bare content, it was amazingly done. It is not ranked too high, though, but I can easily see why. It is probably because this Anime is kind of dark, but in another way. It is difficult to define, but it did not feel like there was much life, or maybe unentertaining would hit the meaning. What I am basically talking about, is that it is more or less difficult to concentrate on the conversations, because they did not have an interesting shape. I actually had to watch the first ten minutes twice in order to prevent getting lost and actually understand the plot. 
 
Speaking of the plot, it is definitely interesting. The plot is about various feminine high school students who all of sudden suicided, without having an actual reason for it. They had a splendid life, and there was one conspicuous similarity between all of those deaths - namely that all of them jumped from the top of a high building, but on the same building. A girl named Shiki went to the place because she was curious about it. That building is definitely suspicious, it is abandoned, maybe it is cursed, which is why Shiki went in it, and this is where the Genres start getting more meaning. 
 
Eventually you are asking this question yourself as well, why does a girl have to do this? Why did the police not investigate the building? So far, this is an unclarified question, which I might have missed, though. The story definitely shows potential, but this is all I can say about it, really. It was not shown much enough to judge the story as a whole, but it seems definitely promising so far. It is quite original as well. Considering there are two really high ranked movies, I can easily this getting one of the best stories ever. Knowing that fact, it will be difficult to predict the story, although I already now have no clue what this could become. 
 
For some reason, this movie reminded me a little bit of Fate/Zero. The plot is different in all considerable ways, but both give me a similar feeling. Not only the art is almost completely the same, even the soundtrack sounds slightly identical. Well, most of the tracks do not sound similar, but sometimes the soundtrack manages to create an identical atmosphere between both. It is definitely not a bad thing, though, and I believe I am one of the only persons who does actually think so. 
 
It is enough to see only one or two minutes of this movie to get the feeling of hardly belief that this movie is actually made in 2007. The backgrounds are immensely detailed, sometimes even too immensely for my liking, the characters look amazing and the animation is magnificent as well. The mere background art makes you want to stare at the screen the whole time, and it perfectly conveys the atmosphere a real thriller Anime needs. Like aforementioned, the art is pretty much the same of Fate/Zero, just with a slightly lower quality. It even uses these awesome background effects, such as the mist you might notice. The art is absolutely perfect. 
 
The soundtrack is certainly one of the best soundtracks ever. There is one melody that constantly pops up in this movie and I can not get it out of my mind. It sounds kinda heart-warming, mystical, and beautiful. It is not only that theme, the rest sounds awesome and fitting, too. I have rarely seen something like this before, and especially that it feels so special in a movie that does not even last for an hour, makes it even more special. The characters were voiced decently as well. There is still something regarding the sound I disliked; the sound effects. They sound unrealistic and unfitting sometimes, and sometimes, even sounds were missed. 
 
Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is a little bit difficult to determine a score when there is not even a real end and when there are barely any development remarks in a movie of this length, so I'm forced to rate it from my so-far-impression. Usually, even when there are several Anime seasons, they have an actual end which makes it possible to judge, but this case is different. But so far, I have a good impression of this Anime and this will probably become one of my favorites, because this movie is in comparison to some other KnK movies, ranked fairly low, but is still impressive. I will make sure to watch and review the rest as well.

          
 
       Helpful Introduction 
First I want to start of by saying this really confused me and I'm still not 100 percent sure what happened but I will give my opinion here with reasons. 
 
Story 
Ok, so we have cops, death - suicides, supernatural beings and it worked out decently but it left me really confused at the end. I have seen other reviews which state this is the first of seven movies in the series. So maybe this classed as just the prologue? Because I feel like there wasn't much given away...explainations below. 
 
Art 
But before I tell you about that we have art. The art was very nice in this anime and I doubt you will be dissapointed. There was always alot going on in the background and the characters and scenary was well drawn. 
 
Sound 
The sound wasn't much worse than the art it has nice BGM and a good atmosphere through out the movie regarding music. 
 
Character 
Okay back to my confusion. After watching this I don't feel like I know much of anything about the characters nor what happened to them or where they came from etc etc all the works. The main character doesnt seem to be human and seems quite uptight...but has a soft side to her...even at that I'm just guessing...sorry but I could only give this a 6. 
 
Enjoyment 
Okay this was quite enjoyable but what let is down was that I was glued to the seat wanting to know more...and that time never came. As a standalone this would've got a 4-6 rating here but because I found out it's the first of 7 movies. I gave it a 7, under the condition that I will find out the answers I'm looking for in sequals. It wasn't treated as a cliff hanger...just unfinished. It's fustrating not knowing what exactly happened or who people are and how they can do certain things. 
 
Overall 
I'm not entirely sure about this like I've said before but giving a guesstimated average on story art sound character and enjoyment...congraulations kara no kyoukai...a 7 out of 10 overall for confusing me =]

Little incongruities that occur around these nine eventually lead to a larger, unimaginable event that may alter what is considered common sense in this world.
","I really don't write reviews, but I felt like this show in particular deserved one considering the response it has gotten from most people in the community.  
 
Occultic;Nine, for lack of a better word, was a total mindfuck through and through. I almost dropped this anime after the 1st episode because of how ""all over the place"" it was. But after discovering that they squeezed an entire volume+ into the one episode, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. In fact, it actually became significantly better right from the 2nd episode on.  
 
The mystery just kept getting thicker with each episode, the supernatural phenomenon presented added an ominous feeling to the show, and the scientific principles surrounding said phenomenon kept me intrigued to learn the truths behind this mystery.  
 
Now as for the bad, like many others (basically everyone on this page lol), the pacing was pretty bunz to say the least. The show being a 12 ep season did not do the story justice, and the rapid dialogue didn't help it either. There were many times where I was genuinely lost in the story because I had no idea what was going on, and at first, I thought the reason for the fast-paced talking was to make the characters come off as more intelligent than they really were (cuz we all know when you spout facts out really quickly, you're basically a genius). It wasn't until towards the end that I realized that the production team was going balls deep to try and fit in all this plot and development into the few episodes that they had... 
 
This is by far the biggest complaint for many viewers, but for me, it honestly did not bother that much. The whole reason for this review is to give credit where credit is due.  
 
This anime had great character design, art, atmosphere, and sound. I appreciated all these elements despite having to deal with a ""rushed"" story. I completely see why people are disappointed. A lot of questions were left unanswered, our main character didn't get the happy ending some of us were expecting (especially after seeing how convenient the final episode was laying it out to be), and the potential for an incredible mystery was somewhat lost in order to speed up the story.  
 
For me, I really enjoyed this anime to the end. I personally didn't find the final episode to be confusing at all. Instead, I thought it to be one of the easiest episodes to understand, and a perfect way to tie any major plot points that confused me. Sure the pace could have been much better with more episodes, but sometimes those things may be out of your control, and perhaps they have some sort of plan in mind if they were able to continue this story.  
 
Overall I give this an 8/10. Many see this anime as a big let down, but I want to see it as an anime with the potential to provide one amazing story. It has its flaws, but I feel they're already stepping in the right direction. 

          
 
       Helpful With the legacy of Steins;Gate behind it and a multitude of very polarized reviews, I fully expected Occultic;Nine to be one of those extremely metaphorical anime with a unique, nontraditional narrative that a lot of people just don't ""get.""  
 
I'm fully aware of how pretentious that sounds, but not enjoying those anime isn't a bad thing in my opinion, it's just a different method of storytelling that works for some and doesn't work for others. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is not one of those. What Occultic;Nine lacks in genuine symbolism and unique storytelling, it attempts to make up for with implausible pseudosciences, plot contrivances, unnecessary (and subsequently abandoned) plot threads, and what may possibly be the most abhorrent pacing and plot decisions I've seen in an anime in a very long time.  
 
-Story: 4/10  
 
It starts out good enough, with an interesting cast and genuinely intriguing mysteries. Though the pacing starts out as bad as it ends, I actually initially found myself drawn to the breakneck conversation speed and scene-to-scene transitions. It meant that every second of this anime was important, and there would be virtually no filler or fluff content. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine actually managed to teach just how important filler content can be, even in a 12-episode anime.  
 
It really wouldn't be wrong to classify this anime as only one, really long exposition dump. Even in important action scenes, there's nonstop explanation coupled with the distracting visuals. The longer the anime runs for, the weaker and weaker the actual plot becomes. Whereas Steins;Gate devoted a large portion of its runtime to making its science at the very least plausible within the unique constraints of its universe, Occultic;Nine quite literally gave the impression of making things up as it went along. The premise seems to promise a unique, ambiguous debate between the scientific and the occult, but in reality the show is more or less ""made up science with a few  unimportant urban legends thrown in for good measure."" 
 
Subplots seem to come and the disappear as quickly as they were launched into the show.  Though the anime does attempt to explain the driving forces behind the main plot, it still leaves an offensive amount of unanswered questions and unresolved character plots. Also, in the midst of its ""explanation"", several points of the plot hinge on what can only be called contrivances. Contrivances that go far beyond Deus Ex Machina and enter the territory of ""the writers honestly had no idea how to fix this mess so they just made the solution appear out of thin air.""  
 
All in all, the terribly paced and inconsistent storyline culminated in an ultimately unsatisfying ending that didn't leave me wanting more, and instead just made me relieved it was finally over. I wasn't left with a desire to learn more about the characters or the world of Occultic;Nine, I was instead left frustrated and annoyed at the lack of basic storytelling integrity present all throughout this anime.  
 
-Art: 6/10 
 
Though the animation and character designs are nice enough, there's often a complete disconnection between what's happening visually, and what's being said. Normally, you'd expect dialogue to frame a scene and interesting visuals used to make an otherwise boring-but-necessary conversation fun to watch, but Occultic;Nine fails in all aspects, quite miserably I may add. Exposition dumps are accessorized with awkward, disjointed camera angles and extremely forced perspective that makes the rapid expositioning even more difficult to listen to. The further you get into the show, the more its predictable and amateur visuals blend together and the easier it gets to completely tune out, which given the sheer amount of exposition present in any given scene, is not a good thing.  
 
-Sound: 7/10 
 
Probably my highest point of compliment, which is... sad. The opening and ending are nice enough as standalone songs and the OST does a fine job of creating the right atmosphere throughout the anime. Unfortunately, though, no tracks particularly stood out as breakout or iconic works. Good, but ultimately forgettable.  
 
-Character: 4/10 
 
This is probably where the anime falls short the most. Right away the anime introduces us to not only the main cast, but several minor characters as well.  The rapidfire pacing is what makes it possible to fully introduce so many characters at once,  but despite the information overload, only a handful of these characters actually end up being necessary. Major characters start out with important subplots that lead nowhere, and minor characters are given last-minute evolutions to major players in the events of the story. Altogether though, there is virtually no character development. The show ends with virtually the same cast it began with. This is due largely to so many characters getting very little screentime, with several of the 'major' characters getting maybe 3-5 scenes of important dialogue in the entire anime. The cast is largely held together by a few inconsequential character traits with little to no depth, which is rather unfortunate given their admittedly very interesting designs.  
 
-Enjoyment: 4/10 
 
If you're a longtime fan of anime, then you should know that sometimes even a bad storyline and bad characters aren't always dealbreakers. Despite everything, sometimes a show just has a certain spark, an appeal that makes it enjoyable even though by all means it shouldn't be. I was desperately looking for that piece of Occultic;Nine throughout its entire run. I really wanted to like it. I really wanted it to be a good anime. But, unfortunately (I've certainly used that word a lot), it almost totally lacked enjoyability for me. It isn't even good in a ""so bad its good"" kind of way. Sure, there are a lot of very laughable plot points, but altogether, it hardly stands as something you can use to just pass the time. 

          
 
       Helpful First off, I'd just like to say that for me at least the art was one of the best parts of this show. It's a really interesting style and there are a lot of interesting shots. 
 
The characters were also well done and developed, though the way they designed Ryouka's character is rather... questionable. The rest of the characters all look great though. 
 
The story is by far the most interesting part of the show. It's a mystery with a bit of a thriller-aspect to it (like the SciAdv series by the same author), and I personally found it very engaging. I would say that the pacing is slightly off in some parts; the last episode in particular had way too much going on in it. 
 
For me though, the greatest issue I had with this entire show was the speed of the dialogue. I'm sure if I was fluent in Japanese, this show would be a point higher for me, but since I'm not, the speed at which they talk sometimes leaves you having to rewind, pause, and then read the subtitles again. Maybe I'm just not a fast enough reader, but anyways. 
 
Overall a pretty engaging show if you don't drop it after the first few episodes because of the pacing and the speed of the talking.

16,696,87,4.329489217,Detective and his or her helper,Tenchi Muyou!,"Tenchi Masaki's life changes forever when the ship of an infamous space pirate, Ryouko Hakubi, is shot down and crashes near his family's temple. Little did Tenchi know that by saving Ryouko, he would spark a series of events that would lead alien women from all walks of life to inhabit his home. This includes the delicate Princess Aeka of Jurai and her playful younger sister Princess Sasami; the scatterbrained first-class detective Mihoshi Kuramitsu and her more capable partner Kiyone Makibi; and the eccentric, mad scientist Washuu Hakubi. 
 
The six women do their best to adapt to their new lives, but their more advanced and exotic lifestyle does not mesh well with the simplistic customs on Earth. As a result, they just end up making a mess and causing trouble for poor Tenchi. Though the girls are a pain, Tenchi begins to form a close relationship with each of them, and through their bond, he begins to gain a better understanding of his role in the universe. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Space']","Long ago, a legendary warrior and crown prince of the Juraian Empire, Yosho, disappeared and never to be heard again. Unknown to the Juraian Empire, Yosho never wanted to become a ruler and only wanted a quiet peaceful life; he settled on Earth. He discovered the Misaki Shrine and married the daughter of the Misaki priest, Itsuki Masaki; he would rename himself as Katsuhito Masaki. The two later had a daughter, Lady Achika Masaki, princess of Jurai. She would later marry her high school love, Nobuyuki, and the two had Tenchi. Unfortunately, Achika died from illness one snowy winter; Nobuyuki and Katsuhito helped raise Tenchi in the country side, near the Misaki Family Shrine. Tenchi's life was at first normal, but things quickly changed when intergalactic alien girls started coming into his life.
At 17, Tenchi's life was dramatically changed by the appearance of Space Pirate Ryoko. Evading the Galaxy Police (GXP), Ryoko was piloting her spaceship and cabbit, Ryo-Ohki, and battled with GXP officer Mihoshi when both crash-landed near Tenchi's home. Tenchi found an unconscious Ryoko and tended to her. When she awakened, she gave a fantastic story of how she's being pursued by a terrible space pirate, temporarily earning the Misaki family's trust and gaining their shelter. However, Ryoko's lies easily fell apart when it was discovered her pursuer was actually the GXP and Ryoko is the true pirate. Unfortunately, with Mihoshi's ship destroyed, it was pointless to arrest Ryoko; both girls stayed at the hospitality of the Misaki house.
Desiring to return home, Mihoshi activated an emergency beacon and it was detected by Juraian Princess Ayeka. When Ayeka arrived, she was shocked to find her old nemesis, Ryoko, was there. Starting a fight, the two battled each other by ship combat and both lost their ships in battle; Ayeka ended as the recent addition to the Misaki household, along with her robotic wooden guardians, Azaka and Kamidake. Not long, Ayeka's little sister, Princess Sasami, had arrived to rescue her sister.
It was around this time that Ryoko revealed that her ship can regenerate itself. In her cabbit form, Ryo-Ohki developed a great love for carrots and couldn't get enough of them. By the time Sasami arrived, both Ayeka and Ryoko developed romantic feelings for Tenchi. Reluctant to leave, it was time for everyone to part ways. Unfortunately, Sasami accidentally had a carrot with her and it attracted Ryo-Ohki. The cabbit couldn't resist the lure of the carrot and collided with each other's ships, causing everyone to be stranded on Earth.
The final two ladies to arrive would be legendary mad scientist Washu and Mihoshi's partner, Kiyone. Washu was imprisoned in a special crystal prison for her crimes of creating time-space devices with devastating effects upon the galaxy. Washu's crystal crash-landed in Japan and the inhabitants founded the Misaki Shrine to prevent people accessing the crystal, correctly assuming it's not a safe object. However, thanks to Ryoko's intervention, she was accidentally freed. She eventually set up two dimensional doorways within the Misaki house, one in a closet allowing her to cross dimensions between her lab and the Misaki family and the other in the bathroom creating a male and a female bathroom to allow privacy.
Lastly, Kiyone was sent to find Mihoshi. After finding her, the two were assigned to patrol and tour the Solar System; it's a severe downgrade. Both lived away from Tenchi's home and have their own place in the city, but due to Mihoshi's frequent blunders, making a living on Earth and balancing GXP duties was hard and Kiyone curses her fortunes because of it. Despite the occasional flares in battles between Ayeka and Ryoko, life was relatively alright until the Juraian military had come for the princesses.
Unknown to the princesses, the Juraian royal hierarchy of power was usurped by the sudden return of Yosho; it was actually Kagato in disguise. Yosho and Kagato both battled for the succession of Jurai in the past and Kagato lost. However, with Yosho conveniently missing, Kagato took his place as the long lost direct heir to the throne. Kagato then used his royal authority to have the military arrest and prosecute both princesses in an attempt to solidify his dominance in Jurai. The Juraian military arrived at the shrine and transported the house with everyone except Tenchi, Ryo-ohki, and Katsuhito into a battleship, seconds later, returning everyone except Ryoko and the princesses and shrinking the house and the robots into handheld sizes. However, they used Kiyone's cruiser and Ryo-ohki to free them and were on the run. Although not originally involved, the GXP was also under the influence of the Juraian Empire and Mihoshi managed to learn about the corrupted collusion between the GXP and Jurai; it made both Mihoshi and Kiyone fugitives. Framed for crimes of treason and terrorism against the crown, the whole group is on the run from the Juraian Empire and the GXP; they journey  to Jurai in attempts to clear their names.
Being on the run was a difficult process. The group had to escape detection from local authorities on top of the GXP, but also make money in between to cover costs for food, fuel, and repairs to their ship. Washu was able to restore the robots to original size and operation as well as the house within the cargo hold of the ship, which served as the main area, excluding the cockpit, for the entire crew(same as it had on Earth).Things were often complicated due to Mihoshi's constant blundering nature as well as Ryoko's selfish nature. On top of that, Ryoko is also evading a long rival, Space Hunter Nagi, while committing major thefts to help sustain the group. However, the group managed to make it to the inner Juraian System.
Disguising their ship and themselves as a school group, the team had success infiltrating Juraian security thanks to Washu's anti-detection measures; it was once again fumbled by Mihoshi. Nearly unable to escape, the group was secretly aided by a loyalist to escape. While on their way to Jurai, Mihoshi's clumsy nature got them detected by a Jurian warship. However, Katsuhito instructed the crew how to escape capture: by entering a forbidden Juraian planet. Because it's a sacred place that nobody is allowed except Juraian royalty, their pursuers was forced to stand down until permitted entry. In order to take back Jurai, the team is going to need powerful warriors. Yosho decided to resurrect two legendary Juraian knights, the real bodies of Azaka and Kamidake, to aid in their quest. Although the Juraian knights have returned, their robotic counterparts were deactivated to bring them back. It was there that Katsuhito revealed himself as the true Yosho and the knights pledged loyalty to Yosho as their king.
It was at a Juraian villa that Yosho explained the nature of their enemy, Kagato, and his past. A rival and Juraian heir, Kagato became too obsessed with power and it caused him to abuse his Juraian powers. Yosho was forced to face his rival and defeated him in battle, but didn't kill him. Kagato disappeared into the darkness and it was around the same time  that Yosho decided to quietly settle down on Earth. Due to the shame and disgrace of Kagato's actions, the Juraian royalty erased the existence of Kagato, explaining why the princesses never heard about Kagato. However, Yosho's identity also pointed out that Tenchi is a direct heir to Jurai's crown.
On the eve before facing Kagato, both Tenchi and Ayeka was affected by recent news the most. Tenchi always saw himself as a normal high school boy, not heir to a major power in the galaxy; Ayeka was happy about it. She always knew her vacation on Earth would eventually end and she would have to bid farewell. However, with Tenchi as a direct heir, they can be together at each other's side for a long time, something Ryoko wasn't happy about. However, romantic intentions have to hold as Kagato appeared.
Kagato appeared for a private rematch with Yosho. Unfortunately, Kagato found a way to maintain his youth and also increased his powers; the aged Yosho lost the battle. Ryoko joined the battle, but was critically injured.  Kagato then kidnaps Ayeka and flees. In critical condition, Yosho encouraged Tenchi to face his destiny with courage. Motivated to end the dark reign of Kagato, Tenchi and the royal knights journeyed to Jurai to face Kagato. Still injured from her fight, Ryoko pleaded with Tenchi to run away with her, but he wasn't swayed; Ryoko offered to take the trio to Jurai.
After Ryo-Ohki crash-landed on Jurai, Tenchi and his guardians stormed the palace. Kagato had his own dark royal knights and they tried to stop Tenchi, but Azaka and Kamidake defeated them both. In between, the rest of the girls managed to hold up the Jurian battle fleet by infecting their computers with a computer virus Washu created. Ryoko was severely injured helping Tenchi, losing a lot of blood, she lost consciousness due to her injuries and her fate unknown. Now at the palace throne, Kagato fought against Tenchi. At first, Tenchi was losing, but the Juraian trees reacted to Tenchi and empowered him to rival Kagato. Theorizing Jurai itself has chosen its own master, Kagato angrily fought against Tenchi and lost; he admitted defeat and died and Tenchi saved Ayeka.
In the aftermath, there was a great media storm over past events. Everyone accused of crimes against the Juraian Empire have been exonerated. Yosho survived his ordeal and was happily treated by a group of pretty Juraian nurses. Ayeka decided not to punish anyone involved with Kagato, but the conspirators themselves quietly resigned to avoid retribution. Washu's involvement made her an honorary president of the Universal Science Academy and she vowed to use her skills for peace; barely a month later, she was ousted for developing a weapon that could destroy the whole universe. At the GXP, Kiyone got promoted to Detective Sergeant and Mihoshi promoted to Chief Criminal Prevention Officer (albeit avoiding her responsibilities to hang with Kiyone). Azaka and Kamidake are no longer royal guardians, but chose to continue serving the princesses. Their robotic counterparts were resurrected thanks to Washu and returns to Ayeka's side. However, Ryoko's fate remains unknown.
As for Tenchi, he has no interest in succeeding as Jurai's next ruler; he just wants to return to Earth and live a normal life. However, there was no mention who would fill in the power vacuum. Tenchi resumes life back as it was, but find it hard to adapt after living with so many girls; he misses them. Just as he thought of them, Ryoko appears before him. She affectionately hugs him and declares that she intends to fairly win Tenchi's heart. It was also around this time that Washu decided to return to Earth. Kiyone and Mihoshi returns to Earth as well, taking back their old apartment. Ayeka decides to run away and return to Tenchi's side; Sasami decides to also run off and the guardians joins in as well. The story ends with all the girls coming back into his life once again.
","Quite a dramatic difference from the Ryo-ohki ova's. they seem to have added more silliness to the story and changed the characters backgrounds completely, and did a total overhaul on washu's personality. She is no longer the deep, calm, and collected person she was in the originals. instead she has become more of a mad scientist with a rediculous ego. though the new storyline is still quite good, the added sillyness and lack of character depth definitly let me down a little bit. but still a good watch.

          
 
       Helpful After following the first 12 episodes of the Tenchi series, what else is there to do? Watch more Tenchi! Although the Universe concentrates on tons of side-stories about enemies, crazy scientist (i.e. Washu), cabbit romances, overthrowing a kingdom (you know, the general line), it is  a good fill of episodes until you get to the &quot;in space&quot; storyline in which you are truly set into the &quot;we've got to get Jurai back&quot; storyline. It has it's great comedic moments, it's tearjerker moments (a certain &quot;death&quot; near the end of the series is a killer...) and the ever happy ending is great. Although I personally love the OVA, the Universe is a great storyline to continue along especially because of all the chaos that happens thanks to Mihoshi. 

          
 
       Helpful Tenchi Universe is a 26 episode series loosely based off of the original OVA Tenchi series, very loosely. It was directed by Hiroshi Negishi (relatively unknown) and produced by the ever pandering company that is Anime International Corporation (AIC). As a big fan of the OVA series, of course the tv series had much to live up to. 
 
Compared to the entrancing beginning that the OVA had or anything else for that matter, the TV series is mostly just filler side-story nonsense focusing around the strange group of women that end up surrounding the main character Tenchi. Sure, the harem is in full swing, but the unique character backgrounds and mystery surrounding a certain family is sort of still there. However, what made the OVA so worth watching and what makes the viewer enjoy each of the unique characteristics of each woman, Tenchi Universe just homes in on pandering to the audience with nonsense panty and boob shots with almost zero story throughout the anime. This is an unfortunate set back to the series for those that truly enjoyed the original. It is not until near of the end of the series (Jurai space arc) where Tenchi Universe finally gets fun. Too bad there is so much filler and side-arc nonsense along the way. 
 
The characters make Tenchi fun, but their reasoning behind their actions and feelings are almost absent, and they just continue to pander as opposed to the OVA which actually created circumstances and choices the characters make to their ultimate decision in the end. How can a 26 episode TV series fall so short compared to a 6 episode OVA? 
 
Naturally, the Tenchi Universe does not look or holds up all that well in terms of animation or in comparison to the fantastic appeal of the OVA. Music is still pretty decent and representative of its time. So, in laments terms, Tenchi Universe falls into the nostalgia category to many fans. Then why not just watch the OVA series instead? 
 
In short, Tenchi Universe in very boring and pandering to the audience. There is little to no content until the group goes to space which is unacceptable for a 26 episode series. Tenchi Universe fall dreadfully into the Ronin Warriors category of, ※just because something was on Toonami in the past, does not mean it is good at all.§ Go watch the Tenchi OVA, not Universe.

His work has culminated in a set of cutting- edge drones equipped with artificial intelligence and incredible technical capabilities; although Allen plans to develop these drones for civilian use, there are others who have more sinister ideas in mind. 
 
On Rikka's 16th birthday, things are forever changed when a paramilitary group raids the Isurugi house in search of the drone technology, killing Allen and Hyoe while Rikka manages to escape with the drones. Months pass, and Rikka is now an ordinary girl working as a private detective while sharing an apartment with another girl, Melissa. But when night falls, she dons her grandfather's fox mask and mercilessly hunts down those responsible for the attack. With the anger she felt that day driving her forward, Rikka will not rest until her family's killers receive the justice that they deserve. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]",['Action'],"Rikka Isurugi is a young girl living at her family home at the edge of Brad City. She is the descendant of ninjas and is expected to follow in the steps of her grandfather, Hyoei Isurugi, and become the next family head. However she wants to be like her father, Allen Isurugi, a renowned robot scientist. One day, Rikka returns home from school for her birthday to find it being attacked by a hit squad led by her father's former colleague, Lauren, intent on obtaining his research, including three AI robotic animal drones: Kasumi the eagle, Oboro the dog and Madara the flying squirrel. Hyoei tries to fight back, only to be restrained and mortally wounded by Lauren's daughter, an esper who is under his control through an electronic collar.

","Disclaimer: I could not find a manga or source material so I did not read the source material if there is any, I only watched the movie.  
 
Story 3/10: The story is very predictable, as many others are saying as well. Nothing stands out as very unique. This serves as a decent introduction to a series, but as a standalone movie there isn't much that makes it interesting. I found myself wanting the movie to be over about halfway through. Although I can say it got better at the end, but not by much.  
 
Art 7/10: The 2D animation is beautiful but ruined in certain parts by extremely poorly blended 3D animation. Studios should know by now that it can and has been blended well before, so for a full length movie to have poor CG is unfortunate. There are definitely parts you can tell the budget went to and that's where the anime shines, but it definitely feels like the movie had a series budget overall and couldn't afford to put too much effort into it's entirety. The CG is what loses 3 points off of an otherwise well animated movie. An extremely well animated section of scenes is what saves the art score, you'll know it when you watch it.  
 
Sound 8/10: I really enjoyed the sound of this movie. I think this is one area that actually turned out great. I recommend watching with headphones. Certain character's voices are just fun to listen to because of the sound design.  
 
Character 4/10: Every character is shallow, but they have potential. The entire movie just felt like it was a set up for an actual series. They all have something that could be good character motivation, but it was so rushed that you don't have time to process it; it doesn't feel like the characters have enough time to process it either. The characters aren't dynamic but will flip flop ideals in less than 60 seconds. I found that a little annoying.  
 
Enjoyment 4/10: It is pretty to look at for a few scenes, but the story and characters aren't developed. I enjoyed watching for the well animated scenes, but it wasn't worth watching for 90 minutes. The end leaves you wanting more, but it's because the movie itself doesn't deliver much.  
 
Overall 5/10: The art and sound bring this anime up but the characters and story are so boring that I can't really recommend it wholeheartedly. All I can say is that the story has potential. It's not bad but it's not great in my opinion. I wish they would've broken this into episodes and made it a prologue to a series. That being said, I'll be keeping an eye on this one to see where they decide to take the story and I'm hoping for a bright future for what could be a good action series.

          
 
       Helpful Watched what I can only assume is the preview movie to this IP and it was pretty generic with some cool points.  
 
The story is that a ninja girl's father and grandfather (where the heck's her mother?Where's anyone's mother in this?) get killed and she's out for revenge. It's like a if batman was a cute anime girl. Except she's not rich...her father was rich and built her some robot side kicks.  
 
The characters are pretty generic too. However, once the team comes together by the end of the movie, they've all been fleshed out a little. Still very troupey through.  
 
The art and animation are really good in this. Probably because it's a teaser movie, so they should be trying to impress us. Character designs are fine. The last fight is particularly very well animated.  
 
Overall, It was a good, quick and painless flick. If the next installment is a episodic show, I don't think I'll watch it. The plot isn't interesting enough to keep me invested for a a weekly basis, and I'm sure it wont be as polished. If it's another movie, then I will watch it. However, I wont change this review or anything. I'm sure another movie will be just as by the numbers.

          
 
       Helpful 1st time reviewing an anime, i'm not english native so my grammar might not be the best and usually i'm the type to be satisfied with others opinion but not today so this will mostly be my subjective review on the film, also this will contain light spoilers about the movie  
 
So this is Black Fox you can go read the synopsis up ahead i'm not going to waste my time on that＃ 
This movie is a huge disapointement especially on the character/character interaction, story/storytelling, the overall tone of the movie being too light hearted and the theme being simply about ""vengeance is meaningless, friendship power is the better way"". 
The art is nice but at times too bright and colorful for the kind of story Black Fox is telling imo, the sound was mostly generic and not memorable, the voice actress did a good job for their given roles, the characters are basic anime tropes and some of them don't even get much screentime and are basically thrown here and there for the comedy, i'm not saying the movie is bad because of that, but that the movie could have had a much better flow if it tried to be more daring and have a more mature approach in everything I mentioned: 
  
-Lilly, the main character, is way too carefree and sentimental based on her background for example: 
 I wish Lilly felt more enclosed and just faking her good attitude towards other but isn't the carefree and joyful kid she was at the beginning because during the movie it doesn't feel like she's concerned about her family loss all that much but rather it's brought back whenever the story feels like making her emotional, at some point she gets revealed that indeed her family is dead for good, and she loses it, it's good but the thing is you just feel like she's reacting to the news, not as if she was getting the thruth she refused to admit all the time she left her parents behind and that would have made for a much satisfying result. 
 
-Or earlier in the movie when she's playing chess with random girl that saved her and it holds a lot of memories with her dad but it doesn't reflect on her behavior and she's basically still as joyful and it doesn't serve any purpose other than introducing rando girl because she kinda becomes important after that while it could also have been used to make her reminiscize about the time she spend with her dad and give her a moment to show that her family disapearance hurts her more than she realizes/wants to admit.  
 
These are some of my complains among others i have against that movie it does seem like I'm trying to push the way I'd imagine this could have gone but It's a shame the movie just decided to stay on a surface level for the story and characters and didn't push for a more ambitious story

Most of them are useless bugs, but very rarely they have useful features that contain information such as sounds and images, and from their unique properties they can be refined into items or Meta-Tags by skilled craftsmen. Because of this, they sometimes fetch high prices and are used as virtual currency for trading Den-noh items only among children. The unit of currency in illegal stores on the Internet is ""meta,"" and 1 meta = 1 yen. However, as Searchmatons delete damaged or corrupted spaces from one side to the other, the scarcity value is gradually increasing.
Kira-Bugs
A kind of special Meta-Bugs that is said to be sold at a high price, some say 30 times the price of a normal one. It is one of the urban legends, and few people have actually seen it.
Meta-Tags
A kind of Den-noh item made from Meta-Bugs, it is a Den-noh talisman with various programs that affect Den-noh space and Den-noh pets. It can only be made by Megab芋, so it is sold only at Megashi-ya, and is the basic tool of the Coil Den-noh Detective Agency. On its surface, it has a pattern similar to the Code Formula. In fact, the Code Formula has its roots in it, and Isako calls it the ""old school"".
Coil-Tags
A Meta-Tag used to return the Den-noh body back into the real body when the Den-noh coil phenomenon occurs.
Imago
A hidden feature of the Den-noh glasses, rumored in urban legends, that allows users to manipulate Den-noh space without using Den-noh items or gestures, just by thinking about it.
Code Formula (做瘍宒, Ang身-shiki)
It is one of the programs that manipulate Den-noh space, and is activated by drawing geometric patterns on the ground or walls with Den-noh chalk. According to urban legend, those who use it are called ""wizards of Den-noh space,"" and are rumored to be hackers who also do illegal things.
Code Reactor (做瘍簪, Ang身-ro)
A structure that is directly connected to imago and can read Code Formula directly from thoughts. By embedding it in a Den-noh body, the Code Formula's features can be used freely and continuously, but it also has dangerous side effects such as damaging the human body and nerves.
""Old Space"" (☆嘉中諾嶲★, ""Furui K迂kan"")
An unstable old version of the Den-noh space, first created and still left in the city. However, it is gradually expanding for some reason in Daikoku City. This is where Den-noh fog, the Illegals, and Meta-Bugs come from.
""The Other Side"" (☆丐勻切★, ""Acchi"")
It is a place rumored in children's urban legends that Kira-Bug and Michiko come from. According to the legend, some children have gone to ""the other side"" in their dreams by sleeping with their Den-noh glasses on. The true identity is a medical Den-noh space created by Coils, the developer of the Den-noh glasses, using Imago, and abandoned by Megamass, which took over the business after Coils' bankruptcy, in order to cover up something. Unlike the Den-noh space, it is an isolated virtual space that is not linked to the real world, so in order to enter it, one must separate their consciousness from their body and become a Den-noh body. This is when the Den-noh coil phenomenon occurs.
C Domain
The official name is Coil Domain, which was used by Coils that developed the first Den-noh glasses.
Daikoku City
A regional city famous for eyeglasses on the Sea of Japan side, not far from Kanazawa City in Ishikawa Prefecture. It is one of the oldest cities in Japan with many historic shrines and temples, and at the same time it is the second largest Den-noh city in Japan in terms of infrastructure related to Den-noh glasses. It is the second semi-governmental special administrative district in Japan, and some people said that its administration is carried out by an affiliate of Megamass. The city hall's space management office manages the Den-noh space in the city, where Yasako's father and Tamako, who are seconded from Megamas, work.
Urban Legends
Among the children of Daikoku City, various strange incidents related to Den-noh have been passed down as urban legends.
Megashi-ya
Den-noh Megane's Dagashi-ya (candy shop) run by Megab芋, abbreviated as ""Megashi-ya"". What she sells to children instead of cheap snacks are powerful Den-noh items that violate the rules of the Daikoku City Space Management Office and are subject to extermination by Searchmaton. She also buys Meta-Bugs, which are used as virtual currency ""meta"" for purchases in her store.
Coil Den-noh Detective Agency
A detective agency led by Megab芋 that solves Den-noh-related problems on request. Their main job is to search for missing Den-noh pets.
Daikoku Heik迂 Club (湮\\諦S窒, Daikoku Heik迂 Kurabu)
A ""cool"" club formed by Daichi with the boys from his elementary school's biology club. ""Heik迂"" means hacker in Chinese. The club was later taken over by Isako. Daichi launched a new club, Original Heik迂 (啋逌\諦, Ganso Heik迂), with Denpa.
Megamass
Megamass is a Japanese global technology company that specializes in Den-noh related businesses, selling products such as Den-noh glasses and Den-noh pets, and providing services to maintain and manage Den-noh spaces and Den-noh navi that manage self-driving cars.
Coils
The official name is Coil Coils, a company that first developed the Den-noh glasses and did some challenging research, but went bankrupt about five years ago. Its technology and research results were taken over by Megamass.
","An abnormally mature anime for its cast. 
 
I will start my review with what is in my opinion the main theme in this series. You have to pursue reality at all cost even if it is sometime quite harsh. The majority of the cast fall into the illusion of that virtual reality depicted in this series. I will go into more details later on. 
 
The story is all about growing up from your childhood and being confronted with reality for the majority of the cast. It tells the story of a young girl and her young sister that arrive in a new city where augmented reality is completely established. In fact, augmented reality is all around town and is making a complete network trough everything. The glasses that connect your brain to the network make possible for you to see the different things that exist only in the virtual side of the city. Things like virtual animal, hacking, false walls or even invisible walls are completely common. 
 
The first part of the anime will only present the different aspect of the city and will give the initial basic background of the different character and their interactions. It will slowly build upon these interactions to something much more interesting and deep than what you may think with the four or five first episodes. 
 
The second part will be about the different difficult pasts of the entire cast and their pursuit of different illusions they have. This part of the show even goes through some terrifying moments for a general quite dramatic atmosphere. Telling more than that would be spoiler. 
 
The art and visual effect inside this anime are remarkable, the virtual side of the city really comes to life and you can easily understand why the children start to believe that these virtual things are as real as the normal world. There's a brilliant use of distortions when some of the virtual things are bugs created by a low maintenance rate. These distortions are also absent when the object has been updated properly. That means you can easily identify a threat to the safety of the children when you see the distorted objects because these objects are borderline always quite dangerous. That is also why some parts of this series are spooky. 
 
The different actors are quite good and credible for making you believe that there are indeed children in the show while there's actually none. The sound effects are always effective and the soundtrack is always in line with what goes on screen. Even the lyrics in the opening section of the show are actually so valid that they are a small spoiler by themselves. 
 
The character all have quite a steep learning curve about accepting their past and present. In the lapse of half a year, they started as people that only wants to escape reality to people that have come full circle with themselves and their past. Traumatic accident and different secrets regarding the new technology present in the city truly make them the only people that can and actually want to find the truth about what has happened in the last years.  
 
All characters go through much development in the course of the show, but five characters go through a lot more than the others. Daichi and his rival seem like a total imbecile, but will be way more than it seems for about half the show. Yasako will, of course, being the main character, have a lot of development, actually way more than one may think. Isako seems selfish, but is actually quite caring. Haraken seem to be quite the normal boy, but knows certain things that will make a lot happening by the end of the show. These three all pursue illusion in the form of memories of a dead someone that have been imprinted inside the network. 
They will of course have to accept these death has been reality instead of relying on that false memory imprint. 
 
My personal enjoyments toward this show comes from the fact that I never think how far the subject of augmented reality could go before watching this series. I learned a lot about how this could be real later on. I also like the mature themes present in that story and I actually liked the fact that the series pretty much put a big middle finger to all those that were thinking that this show will be gentle and relax all the way through. 
 
In conclusion, I recommend this flick for fans of sci-fi and fantasy and also to fans of serious story that have a lot to tell.  


          
 
       Helpful Remember when you were a child? You and your friends were playing, talking about different urban legends and stories. Imagine this situation but add to it another layer of reality. That is Dennou Coil. That and much much more.  
 
Dennou Coil starts in a pretty unforgivable manner. You are thrown into a world of near future where people can access virtual reality via special glasses. This VR is connected to everyday life and exists as another layer of reality. There are virtual pets, lasers, big funny looking antiviruses called Satchii and much more. And there is something else. Something perhaps more sinister hiding inside this space.  
 
The story slowly builds up. Stakes become higher, and as the mysteries begin to get solved you are left with your jaw on the floor.  I have no idea how creators of this anime accomplished task of having incredibly smart and somewhat complex script, which encompasses themes of loss, grief, obsession, humanity, reality, love and hate while still being a kids show.  
 
The characters are relatable, funny and quirky. Each of them has their flaws and each of them has their goals. No character exists only to move plot forward or be a clich谷 role player. 
 
Production is great. Even though the series slightly suffers from bland colour pallet it is intentional and meaningful. The animation itself is very soft. The way some characters act and move reminded me of works of Hayao Miyazaki. My only problem with the production are the character designs (especially their noses, they kinda look like monkeys)   but that＊s purely subjective and won＊t really affect the overall score.  
The music is noticeable in a good way. Playful tones during comedy scenes mix well with violins during serious scenes, creating good contrast. Some anime tend to overblow the playfulness or seriousness but Dennou Coil creates a good mix.  
Voice acting is good. One of the characters sounds older than she should but I understand why it is the case so I can overlook it.  
 
As for enjoyment I had a blast. The main storyline is excellently structured. Few of the episodes from the middle of series could be considered as ※filler§ since they don＊t really add much to the main plot line but these episodes in on itself are very well written and serve as simple exploration of deep themes . Once again I must praise the way writers handled such things in understandable and meaningful manner. There is one half recap episode but I think I can forgive the show for that one.  
 
Overall this is an excellent anime that works for kids and adults alike. The story is simple enough that a child could understand it but complex enough that an adult would be interested. It teaches valuable lessons, is funny, smart, scary at times, and overall enjoyable. According to rumors, it also has best dog in anime.  


          
 
       Helpful The series was very slow and child-like in the very beginning...but about halfway through it was CRAZY AWESOME! The plot thickened with every episode and the cliffhangers were outrageous. The animation is beautiful, and it captures science fiction in a very realistic perspective, as opposed to the usual sci-fi that just has stylized robots and space ships. The character development is interesting, but really the show is all about how creepy the technology is. I can honestly say I am thoroughly impressed with Denno Coil. NOT what I expected at all.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller', 'Shounen']",none,"Alright everyone. if you have not seen this yet it is a MUST! It is one of the best animes out their in my opinion. This anime is a shorter anime with under 60 episodes long and it kept my leaning at the edge of seat. The story starts with a necessary build to introduce the deathnote, but never makes it too slow to get bored of the show. Then it starts getting interesting when they investigate how so many people are dying and why. From this moment on it is pretty much a game of chess between the two main characters which gets intense pretty quick. From there in the story untill the end of the show it keeps its high intensity. The characters in this show are relatable to real life people and what actions they would do which makes it such a great anime.Hopes you guys love it as much as I did.

       Helpful I just finished watching Death Note last night, and I just had to write a review for the series. 
 
After my friend spending months trying to get me to watch Death note, I decided, ""what the hay, I might as well give it a try."" From the very first episode I was hooked. 
 
Story: I like the story a lot. I thought it was pretty original compared to a lot of anime's I've seen where the plot is recycled. If you don't know already, the Death Note is a notebook in which whose ever name is written down in it will die. Him or her will die in 40 seconds if the writer doesn't specify when they will die. If the cause of death is not written, then the person written down in the note will die of a heart attack. It's not that simple. For a person to die, you need to know their name and their face for the death to take place. These notebooks are in the world of the Shinigami, or death Gods, if you will, and the shinigami only use them to lengthen their lives by taking away from the humans lives. Well what happens when the notebook is dropped onto earth and the power of the Death Note is passed onto a human? Lets just say calamity ensues.  
 
Pick your own definition of justice. Light or L. 
 
Characters: I absolutely loved the characters in Death Note. Although I wasn't on their sides most of the time, (mainly Light) I still liked the character development as well as the character design. L and Light are very intellectual and mysterious in someways; it adds to the story. There are many times throughout the series where you think, ""Nuh-uh, how the hell did he think of that?"" Basically they're not very predictable. 
 
I adored the first theme song; I think it's called ""the world"" by nightmare. I thought it went perfectly with the series and it truly did get me amped up to watch the show. I never skipped the theme song, even when I watched many episodes in one sitting. The second theme song was a little to creepy in my opinion. It made everything seem all dark and demonic, although you can argue that it fits in with DN too. I wouldn't disagree, it just wasn't my taste. 
 
There are moments in Death Note where you're just thinking, "".... Seriously? Why did they even do that?"" - useless moments that don't add or subtract from the storyline. Death note hits a boring patch for a bit. Well, I mean it still is kind of interesting, but the episodes beforehand were more alluring. But trust me, it does get out of the 'slump'. 
 
The thing I like about this series is that they did things that deliberately pissed off fans of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything, but they did the unthinkable in certain cases, and it just added onto the overall effect of the show and made it seem more real, so to speak. 
 
The overall enjoyment of this show was high, and I would highly recommend it to people who haven't seen the series. Even if you're a Rom/com junkie like I ;) Death Note is still a good investment. Only will take 37x23m to watch ;D

16,3342,91,4.096315841,Detective and his or her helper,Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi,"For normal people, getting stabbed to death would constitute the end of the road. For Rin Asogi, it's a mere inconvenience. Rin is immortal, a nice perk to have when you're a private detective constantly finding yourself in dangerous situations. 
 
Rin has eaten a ""time fruit"": a fruit from the guardian tree Yggdrasil, which, when consumed by a woman, makes her unable to die. Rin's immortality doesn't stop others from trying to kill her, of course; over her long lifetime she has been shot at, cut up, maimed, tortured, and suffered countless other violent deaths. 
 
This time, it's different. The year 1990 sparks the beginning of a series of events in Rin's life that sends her spiraling toward her fate. Someone is hunting down immortal women like Rin, and Rin's life may be in actual danger. 
 
 Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi  spans 65 years in Rin's life, during which she watches those around her get old while she herself remains unchanged. Higher forces are after her, and Rin must use every means at her disposal〞or her next death may just be her last.

A small proportion of the orbs are special ones known as ""Time Fruits"". If a Time Fruit enters a female, she becomes Immortal. If a Time Fruit enters a male, he becomes a crazed winged being known as an ""Angel"". Rin Asougi is an immortal who runs a private investigation agency in Tokyo's Shinjuku district alongside her assistant, Mimi who is also immortal. Rin often converses with a mysterious unknown individual on the phone. She is often being hunted down by an assassin named Laura who was hired by Apos, an angel who persecutes immortals and is the current guardian of the Yggdrasil.
The story begins in the year 1990. During a search for a missing cat, Rin instead finds Koki Maeno, a young man with distorted memories. As she investigates his past, she discovers that he is a clone created by Sayara Yamanobe, a woman searching for immortality. After discovering this, Koki decides to work for Rin in her agency. In 2011, Koki marries a former client, Yuki. Sayara Yamanobe returns, kidnaps Rin and attempts to attack Japan with biological weapons. Koki, after becoming an Angel, sacrifices himself to save Rin and Japan. In 2025, Rin ends up investigating a case involving Koki's son, Teruki, after he meets his long-term cyber girlfriend in reality. Rin manages to save Teruki; however, she ends up sacrificing herself.

However, she regains her memories when Laura discovers she's alive and attempts to kill her. After Apos kidnaps Rin, Mimi and Teruki's daughter Mishio travel to Apos' castle to save her.

       Helpful These are elements in most things media that you as the viewer are attracted to or appalled to and in this case, there are many anime that is clearly not meant for everyone and it＊s not just the pointless fan service anime or the very, very nauseating hentai titles but more titles that are too risqu谷 for TV but instead went into the OVA format and that is where Rin Daughters of Mnemosyne come to mind and when first hearing about it based on most reviews and just shootin＊ the shit with some people, some say it＊s either good, perverted, creepy, etc. but then again, I＊ve been reviewing anime for two years now and I have seen way worse material than what they describe and so I went inside an open mind and that＊s all I wrote. 
 
Rin Asogi is an immortal private detective with a thirst for vodka and a talent for attracting things that go bump in the night. In a series of nightmarish vignettes spanning sixty-five years, Rin＊s lush body is sadistically pierced, blown up, and mulched to a bloody pulp. The fiend behind her tortured existence is Apos, an eternal being obsessed with sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil, the tree of all life. While Rin struggles to unravel the secrets of her endless agony, Apos lurks in the shadows, eager to tear into her ripe body and devour the memories of her countless lives. Rin＊s no stranger to the realm of the dead, but her next visit could last forever. 
 
And the result was that the show was＃＃while it has very strong sexual and erotic themes and there is copious amounts of graphic violence in the show, I didn＊t really feel that creeped out by it because in actuality, those themes fit within the show without it being played for shock value. Like I said, I have seen much worse than this. Elfen Lied, I feel was creepy, pretentious, and only being played for shock value for most of the part and also it fits the context. It doesn＊t seem out of place or inappropriate that you wonder what the hell you just watch. The story does introduce immortals, which most people are familiar with if they saw Baccano! And believe me, Rin gets in most situations where any person would just up and die. However, while Rin is an immortal, I did felt like she was in real danger most of the storyline does go through 5 timelines from the 1990s to 2011 to the very near future of 2055 within the span of 6 45-minute episodes, the pacing was smooth as when an episode end, it feels more conclusive and episodic at least for the first 4 episodes and while it has that monster or bad guy of the week (actually, year) format, it never felt as tiring or easily bored. As of what I thought about the main plot, I was confused at some times but then again, like most shows, I get the idea just about a few episodes in and it is an interesting yet devious plot. 
 
I do like the duo of Rin Asogi and her assistant Mimi as likable characters although while everything around them change, from cities to people to technological advances, they actually don＊t considering that I always remember the line of when Rin wants some water and Mimi gives her Vodka and says, ※Vodka is Russian for water§ and that is repeated for the first 4 episodes. The Maeno family are the most interesting characters as you see different variations of them from Koki to his son Teruki and to Teruki＊s daughter Mishio and it does show how well-connected they are to Rin and Mimi. Apos, the main antagonist of the show, isn＊t exactly as textbook ※take over the world§ villain as I thought. He does it with sex and murder. 
 
Xebec is in charge of the animation and while I had my gripes with them on a few titles that I either watched and/or reviewed, this is definitely a far cry from the usual material they often make. The art style and animation is fine with the setting within the in-universe changing from either a year or two to 10 to 50 years. The gore and violence factor is very high so this is definitely not recommended for those who have weak constitutions or not much of a gore/violence fan. 
 
I really, really, really love the opening theme and I also thought the ending song was decent but not exactly high on my list as the opening and ending are both sung by Galneryus and while I like it, I can＊t really say it fits to the show although some of the time, it does. 
 
As for the English dub, the FUNimation dub leaves me not wholly satisfied as while Colleen Clinkenbeard was perfectly cast as Rin, I seriously can＊t picture Jamie Marchi as Mimi. I like Marchi as a voice actress and I appreciate her going for a role outside of how she＊s usually cast but she sounded kind of screechy in her role. Todd Haberkorn manages to give a decent performance as Apos and all around, the dub is＃.well, the FUNimation standard of dubs. 
 
FINAL VERDICT: In short, I really enjoyed watching this show. I like that while it does have those themes I＊ve mentioned earlier, it manages to fit with the context of the show and not feel out of place and if the show creeped you out, then the show did what it needed to do. I guess if you are a fan of shows like this, then this is made for you.

          
 
       Helpful So, I watched this series through twice, the reason being, so I could get a hold of my opinions on it. A friend of mine said that it had an original story and aesthetic that I would appreciate if it weren't for the gore and liberal use of sex and nudity. I took this as a challenge (I don't care for anything sadistic, and think that sex and nudity should be used as seasonings for a story, not what they revolve around) and did watch, but I can't say that I'm not still a little confused. 
 
The Good: 
1) This is an original story for sure. I would have gone with more of a 'trials of the immortal' thing than the story did, but that's my preference. 2) I'm a fan of these time skips. It shows the characters in a completely different character when you see them in the next episode 20 years later. Plus, it reminds me, somewhat, of Kara no Kyoukai. 3) It made me think. I will profess to enjoying mindlessness on occasion, but I enjoy it when there are things I don't know, am confident will be revealed, then realize I should have seen them from the beginning in hindsight. 4) The main characters can, or may not be, the most interesting characters in your mind. As the description says, we're talking about immortals here, so that can be hard to relate to, but the secondary characters, to me anyway, pepper the narrative with what makes it good. 
 
The Bad: 
1) Sex should not play an integral role unless the story is a romance or smut. I realize this is an opinion, but when talk of sexual arousal stopping a hardened female action character comes up, I find it difficult to swallow. 2) If you want to be mature, and appeal to a mature audience (as your rating seems to insinuate), using a juvenile 'blood and boobs' routine isn't going to help. 3) The intro song. Yes it's petty, but it doesn't change the fact that it suckered me in with a fair musical score and ruined it with j-rock lyrics sung by the one kid who failed his english classes. There's a reason I don't sing in Japanese, despite knowing how to, at least, communicate on a daily level in it. 
 
The Ambiguous: 
1) Gender politics. I don't know if the creators are trying to make a message out of what happens when men and women gain power followed by the interactions of said parties, but it comes across that way. Maybe that's how it supposed to be. The main character kicks enough ass to put the Levi jeans company into overdrive, but is still forced to submit at times (normally in a sexual manner; see 'The Bad' section on that). 
2) The Sexual Politics. Again, this is a sort of gender politics thing that I can't get too much into without going into spoiler territory, but I will say there is a lesbian threesome during which important information is shared among the participants. Now, as an adult male, let me say, this information could have been presented better. It was certainly artistic and erotic, but difficult to hear over the sexual groans of those involved. Added to that is that, apparently, the best way to get information relevant to plot points is to sexually satisfy a nymphomaniac lesbian (or bisexual, it was never made clear). This could have been handled better, but I don't know if the anime as a whole could maintain its identity without such... accoutrements.  
3) What is actually happening? Keeping your audience in the dark until just the right moment is a skill few possess. In this anime, the dark shifts back and forth between knowing and not knowing. While generally well paced on an episodic level, I would have preferred a more cohesive whole than what was presented, despite the fact that I appreciate the segments on their own. It would probably be better to assess those segments (episodes) individually with more scrutiny, but they do all interconnect. 
 
Conclusion: 
I can't give you any real insight. Go ahead and watch the series for yourself (6 episodes, 45 minutes each) and have your own opinion. You could almost argue that this is an anime for forcing you into creating your own opinion on some issues that come up in modern life or fantasy. But always remember to keep an open mind. Read the other reviews and they might provide more insight than mine ever could.

As a child, average police officer Kirill Vrubel fantasized about being a hero who would save his school from a random terrorist attack. His chance to be a hero arrives when his landlady blackmails him into searching for her lost cat. Upon arriving and falling asleep in an abandoned warehouse, Kirill finds himself in the middle of a hostage situation involving an Anthem user. By teaming up with SEVEN-O detective Douglas ""Doug"" Bilingam, Kirill earns his spot as the newest member of SEVEN-O. Now, with the help of this secret organization, he may finally achieve his dream of becoming a hero. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Police']","In the city-state Lisvaletta, while people go about their tranquil everyday lives, crimes and illegal drugs run rampant. Above all, a dangerous, highly-fatal drug named ""Anthem"" is casting a dark shadow on the streets. The ""Seven-O"" special criminal investigation unit whose speciality is to supervise the investigation of Anthem, institutes a ""Double Decker System"" policy of forming groups of two investigators, and all members are given nicknames.
One team consists of the veteran investigator Doug Billingham accompanied by the rookie Kirill Vrubel. This unconventional duo combines an aloof veteran detective who is hard to get a read on, and an inexperienced detective who is a little too eager.
","It's a shame that this anime has such low reviews on MAL. I hope more people give it a chance because it's such a fun & enjoyable watch as well as an original show. Maybe you aren't fond of the use of CGI, but it was done really tastefully in this series & it doesn't interrupt the animation quality at all here. 
 
The only thing I hope they explore more on is actually Kirill & Doug's relationship. There hasn't really been any development with them as SEVEN-O partners. I get that the other characters need to be introduced as well for us to understand character dynamics & such but that also pushes the main leads out of the picture the majority of the time this season. Hopefully if it goes onto a 2nd season, we will see more chemistry & a deeper more meaningful connection of our two detectives.

          
 
       Helpful I can＊t really imagine a society in our world today without laws. Hell, I can＊t even begin to fandom what would happen if the police force disappeared in my neighborhood. As a police story, Double Decker runs with a plot that managed to capture the essence of crime fighting. I＊m not going to lie, this show made me realize that sometimes, we can make the simplest ideas and turn it into a blockbuster. 
 
As an anime original, Double Decker may look familiar especially those who have experienced a show in the past known as ＆Tiger & Bunny＊. Produced by studio Sunrise, it didn＊t take long to realize the familiar character designs by Masakazu Katsura. Even after all these years, it feels like his talent never left us with these T&B aesthetics. I would also assume the setting of the show takes place in the same universe although that＊s not clear. Regardless, watching Double Decker is a profound experience that I did not regret. 
 
Initially, the first few episodes introduces us to the main character cast. The most prominent characters consists of the SEVEN-O Special Crime Investigation. It shouldn＊t take long for viewers to understand the experience level between investigator Doug Bilingham and rookie cop Kirill Vrubel. To me, they are like Batman and Robin. In other words, Doug plays the role of an action hero while Kirill presents himself as a sidekick. I don＊t want to undermine Kirill＊s credibility because he does have some potential. However, my impression of his character in the beginning was not enthusiastic. He lacks experience and often ends up being the butt monkey for feminine jokes. It doesn＊t help that he looks like a bishounen rather than a cop. This is an antithesis to his partner Doug as he looks much more mature, experienced, and always gets the job done. There＊s a lack of chemistry in the beginning due to their conflicting personalities. However, the two does get along on a professional level and Kirill begins to learn more on the job.  
 
Joining them includes Deana, Katherine, Maxine, Yuri, Travis, Sophie, and Apple. Each of them play a different role that compliments the team overall. For instance, Deana＊s sniper skills is valuable during missions that targets dangerous individuals. Yuri possesses computer skills that provides intelligence to the team. Apple is in charge of maintaining the team＊s equipment and works well with technology. You get the idea. In order to fight crime, it＊s definitely important to establish character roles so this show managed to get that point across from the start. On individual levels, each character has also personalities that sometimes clashes with one another. Because let＊s not forget one thing, it＊s not always easy for everyone to get along on such a dangerous job. Being part of a crime fighting force is not easy when you have a group known as the Esperanza who deals with a powerful drug known as the ※Anthem§. 
 
That actually takes to the core plot of the story. Initially, I had thought the show would involve monster of the week format episodes. The plot evolves more and more as conspiracies, corruption, and the dark side of Lisvaletta is revealed. Esperanza also begins to show to the world more of their dark ambitions that clashes with law enforcement. To me, Double Decker managed to make its antagonists marketable as an international threat in their world. Slowly but surely, their sinister plans come together that really throws off SEVEN from their ordinary cases. Speaking of cases though, I regrettably admit that most of them aren＊t as executed as I had anticipated. Most of them uses recycled ideas such as investigating clues, following up on leads, tracking down the suspect, and bringing them to justice. If you＊re familiar with media like Batman or even Spiderman, you can probably get a sense of these cases are like. Not to mention, the criminals they deal with often resort to using dangerous chemicals and experimentations. It＊s only later in the show we how far the plot deepens to test the limits of our crime fighters. 
 
It would be unfair to say this show is a poor man＊s Tiger & Bunny to be honest. Double Decker works as a successor by using its character relationships to sell its story. We find out more about some of the main characters＊ past too in order to understand them more. And while this show may be goofy at times, it manages to work well for its character partnerships. There are moments where I couldn＊t help but feel attached to them. Make no mistake, you don＊t need to understand law enforcement to watch this show or see Tiger & Bunny. In fact, jumping into Double Decker is perfectly fine with its playful humor and oddball set of characters. It still contains its emotional content as the main characters tackles on social issues. An elephant in the room also exists with the same gender relationships. However, it＊s far off from a shounen-ai and works more as a buddy cop police tale. 
 
You probably noticed that character designs in this show looks stylish with their looks. Some of them don＊t even look like detectives or like they belong in the police force. An easy finger to point at is Kirill as he＊s often made fun of for his feminine features. Sunrise managed to make Kirill into a comic relief in the beginning for his lackluster skills. It＊s not until later that he becomes more useful to the team. But still, I do applaud the director and studio for recreating a society of these colorful characters. Not to mention, I feel the setting of Double Decker runs well with its technology concepts; namely the Anthem used by criminals and their consequences. 
 
It＊s been around 7 years since Tiger and Bunny made its premiere. This isn＊t really an upgraded or downgraded version as Double Decker is fully a show of its own. What this anime managed to do is creating a story in this fictional society that makes us believe in. Here, we have characters that risks their lives to deal with criminals and showing the dark side of their society. Yet at the same time, it also shows how partnerships can truly be meaningful when the right people work together. 

          
 
       Helpful I'll start this quoting a running gag: 
Double Decker is not an anime about heroes and dreams,  
It's about a bunch of people who can seamlessly turn between 2D animation and CGI. 
 
art: 
No, seriously, the whole series has a combination of 2D animation and 3D animation, and while the 3D segments look and move really good, the 2D animation sometimes fails, not because the movement is bad, but rather because the lines seem more like a rough sketch than the final deal, it's especially noticeable right in the opening, where there is a rather large sections where the images pass from these solid illustrations to something not quite as good looking, it still retains it's good looks when it's important. 
 
Sound, Music: 
Talking about the opening, while rather generic, when it comes to soundtrack, it is not terribly bad. The soundtrack and ending tho, is really good to the ears. The ending might lack animation, but it's quite the bashing song (if you like it), you can tell the band itself made a couple of changes for the official release of it, but that only fixes little things that don't impact the feel of the song. The other music in the anime is also good, but you'll have to pay attention for it as it doesn't stand out as much as other anime soundtracks. The sound effects are rarely unfitting, so I'd say that's not evidently bad, the guns actually sound really good, and so do the voices as you'd expect.  
 
Story and Characters: 
And all of the voices fit the Characters well, although most of them don't get over an episode to develop, but when they do, they become better. Kiril is the main guy, but also the guy who develops the most, and definitely the most enjoyable, that said, all of the characters bounce well with each other as soon as they apear for over 2 minutes at a time, because some characters are definitely left to the side and barely explained and one of them specifically only starts being ""part of the group"" towards the latter episodes. 
That doesn't mean that the characters are perfect, some characters just get a cool trait for the sake of giving them a cool trait and some others do stuff for no interesting reason other than ""Something like this happened to me"" or a bunch of uninteresting reasons. 
The way the anime tells a story is really unique, see, the characters do develop over the episodes, but each episode can be viewed individually and you'd understand them just fine. That does break the immersion, but the fact that it works towards the latter episodes is really good. Each episode has some sort of story development that will come on latter episodes, and similarly to older anime series, the important stuff does come back on the latter half of the anime but it's heavily wiped out in the last episode, so that was rather disappointing.  
 
TLDR: The characters are good, but they are much better towards the latter half of the series. 
 
Finally, I do gotta say that if you like detective story anime, your experience will be much more solid. It's a great anime regardless! 
So when watching this series; Don't Think! Feel so Good!

16,28619,93,4.031183584,Detective and his or her helper,Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace,"After what appears to be just another ordinary day, middle school student Yoshio Kobayashi wakes up in his classroom to make a terrifying discovery: his teacher has been mutilated, and Yoshio happens to be holding the weapon used to commit the crime. 
 
Despite the initial shock of finding himself in this predicament, the curious and detached Yoshio can't help but be secretly thrilled about this attempt to frame him. His put-upon friend Souji Hashiba is turned into a willing accomplice, and together, they are determined to prove Yoshio's innocence. Additionally, Kogorou Akechi, a genius high school detective, has come to the scene of the crime in order investigate the case and when Kogorou meets the young man found guilty, an intense mutual interest sparks between the two of them. Kobayashi wishes to enter Akechi's world of crime solving as his assistant, and Akechi is determined to see if the enthusiastic boy is up to the challenge. 
 
 Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace   is a surreal mystery and horror anime that contains brutal and bizarre crimes, loosely based on stories written by Ranpo Edogawa, who is famous for his influence on Japanese fiction. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]",['Mystery'],"The story begins at a middle school where the murder and dismemberment of a teacher has taken place. Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school and the lead suspect in the case, meets the genius detective Akechi, who comes to the school to investigate. After being cleared of the crime, Kobayashi takes an interest in Akechi and, in spite of his friend Hashiba's worries, volunteers to be Akechi's assistant.
","I write this review with gladness and joy knowing that the Lerche A team was working on worthwhile projects like Assassination Classroom and MonMusu while the Lerche B team was indulging themselves on dollar store mystery novels and power fantasies when they decided to, for some reason, combine the two and animate it. I am willing to say that Seiji Kishi probably just glanced over at Ranpo Kitan's script and waved it off while looking at more worthwhile projects, while the writers took that as a go-ahead and told the animators to get to work. But nonetheless, here we are, with a mystery show that holds an extraordinary ratio of ""piss you off"" in contrast to mystery. Ranpo Kitan is a disgrace to Ranpo Edogawa's work, and if you are thinking of watching this show because you are genuinely curious, I beg of you, the cat may have come back after satisfying its curiosity, but it remained mentally scarred of the horrors it witnessed as a result. 
 
Story: 3/10 
If there's one thing that Ranpo Kitan's story had in common with a regular story, is that I felt a sense of exhilaration when I finished it. This exhilaration is, of course, less because of excitement that I finished a story, but more because of gratitude that I finished this story. The plot is paper-thin, with the script writers probably just looking up ""really really cruel deaths"" on Google and thinking of a real life situation where that could happen. They then had to think of some extremely weird and convoluted way that those deaths would happen, while the main characters are somehow so enlightened in the art of investigation that they can come to a logical conclusion through threads of evidence that don't even tie together. Why this show even bothers trying to be all mysterious is the mystery element, as after the second episode, the ending is usually right in front of the viewer's face as the genius detectives do it again! By somehow tapping into the element of luck itself and hope that their theory, based off of nothing other than logical fallacies and insufficient evidence, works out in the end, which usually results in a confession from the murderer. It's like clockwork, if the clockwork squeaked really loudly and should probably get fixed since it gets more and more annoying at time goes on. The only reason this section is not a 2 or 3 is because of episode 4, but more on that in the Character section. 
 
Art: 6/10 
I really do wonder if the character designers are full of people who unironically say ""the dick makes it better"" when mentioning feminine-looking characters, because that is the main character. Yoshio Kobayashi looks like someone you pull out of a trap doujin and stick clothes on him. And if that's not enough, he apparently has a fetish for crossdressing, so there's an abundant amount of scenes where you have this ""boy"" dressed up in a frilly dress, with an abundant amount of ass shots for some odd reason. Other than this very glaring detail, the art style is nothing impressive, but nothing lackluster. The opening is the only part where I can see any kind of artistic freedom being taken, as the animated characters are interposed between real-life movies. The bondage play in the opening is also well-designed and well-drawn. It also says something about the show when the opening is the best animated out of the entire series. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
I will admit that the opening is the only reason why sound is rated so high, as amazarashi is a personal favorite and I wish they would do more openings and endings for different shows. Other than that, there's nothing really impressive about the soundtrack, and nothing stands out or misses its mark.  
 
Character: 2/10 
Ranpo Kitan is probably one of the only shows I've watched that I wanted the villain to win just to see the MCs die horribly painful deaths because the sheer amount of annoyance and anger that I feel because of them. We have Kogorou Akechi, the boy genius detective who can solve any crime by bullshitting a route of thought and twisting reality so that that route of thought is exactly how the villain thinks, and the villain gets caught. He is apparently so smart, that he doesn't even view other people as humans, but mere shadows on the horizon, uninteresting and bland (quite the parallel to this show). And by Kogorou Akechi I meant Yoshio Kobayashi, since they're literally the same character, except Yoshio is trap bait. In comes Souji Hashiba, the closet homosexual who knows that his best friend is a guy, but is still attracted to his overly-feminine body. But is liking traps really gay? That's a discussion for another time. And so goes the list of characters that I can't remember the names of because they were so generic that I shuffled them into the crowd of people that don't matter. At least one notable exception to these pathetic attempts at character creation is Tokiko Kagami, Keisuke Kagami's little sister. True to her archetype, she is innocent, kind, sweet, caring, and everything you would hope for in a bright and cheerful college-bound girl. When I saw her in episode 4, I immediately felt refreshed, as she, even being a generic archetypal character, is like the first flower blossoming after harsh and snowy winter. I also immediately knew where this episode was going, but that's besides the point. Overall, character is the least qualified category in Ranpo Kitan, although I do realize that that may not mean much. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
The lack of intelligent character design, the lack of intelligent investigation, the prevalence of the Marty Stu, and the lack of mystery in a mystery show makes Ranpo Kitan one of the worst ideas to come out of the otherwise decent studio of Lerche. Uninspired and sometimes downright disgusting character design kills any hope of redemption that the show may have from crawling out of its pit of overused archetypes and overpowered MCs. The only thing that saved this show from being a 4/10 is the existence of episode 4, where the show actually made me feel emotions besides mild annoyance and general distaste. If you are still interested to see what possible good can come of this show, just watch a portion of episode 3 and then episode 4. Trust me. It's as good as its gonna get here, so just sit back and eat your anime-watching snacks with a look of slight disgust on your face as you realize that perhaps the show is ruining the snacks this time, instead of the other way around.

          
 
       Helpful This anime to me resembles a lot like Tokyo ESP v2.0. It is pretty sad to say that Kishi Seiji has declined in quality ever since Persona 4 the Golden Animation which I didn't watch. 
 
STORY (3): 
 
This anime marks the 50th anniversary of Edogawa Ranpo's passing. Edogawa Ranpo was known as the Sir Author Conan Doyle of Japan who produced mystery fiction books. Now, Kishi Seiji the director undergoes this project.  
 
You know a mystery fiction has to build tension and suspense when it comes to mystery solving and riddles to be solved. However, this anime failed on that ground. Everything was extremely clich谷 and countless mystery fiction have done before in the past years. Everything was unresolved at the end. 
 
Some mysteries try to include all those sexual fantasies of the creators which Japan has been infamously known for. I told you I am very tired of all these sexual fantasies of the creators, they have been done to death in the past decade of anime. Like for example Kuro Tokage being tortured and she shows joy, especially Yaoi in this anime. Yes, I'm not joking. 
 
ART (4): 
 
The animation is below average just like Tokyo ESP. The animation never give the other characters some colors, imagine just like Watamote.  
 
SOUND (4): 
 
The opening was the best thing that will ever stay in my head in this anime. 
 
CHARACTER (3): 
 
I really hate to say this but Kogoro Akechi has great character development other than the rest of the casts. Seriously, Kogoro Akechi was like a wish-fulfilment character.  
 
Souji Hashiba is just like another Azuma Kyoutaro with no personality that can stand out among the generic crowd. And do you guys remember Azuma Kyoutaro in Tokyo ESP, neither do I. But I do remember that Azuma Kyoutaro was useless and relied on Rinka Urushiba for help. Just like Souji Hashiba, he barely did anything but just be there for Kobayashi AKA Mr Transvestite. 
 
I will just define Kobayashi's personality with this quote. 
 
I'm just a sweet transvestite from Transylvania. I can't do anything and I jerk around with Akechi & Hashiba.  
 
Kuro Tokage was the most creepiest person in this anime. She tries to be like a sex desire but she became creepy instead. The voice actress Hikasa Yoko this Summer 2015 anime has now voiced actresses that moaned a lot and including one character from Bikini Warriors. She is just a sex model. 
 
The main villain was as clich谷 as the main villain as in Tokyo ESP. 
 
CONCLUSION (3): 
 
It seems that this anime is basically Tokyo ESP v2.0 with mystery that is not compelling and characters that are as bland as they can get. 
 
I've got nothing more to say. Lerche has now declined in quality this year. 
 
This anime gets a 3 out of 10.

          
 
       Helpful Woah, this was a pretty intense anime if I do say so myself. 
 
So to start off here's a short summary: 
Kobayashi,a middle schooler, meets genius detective Akechi due to a murder case that occured in his school. 
He takes an interest in the detective and despite his friends Hashiba's worries, he volunteers to be Akechi's assistant. 
 
So as you can see from the summary the story is obviously a detective genre anime. 
But it's not a series of different cases but matter of fact these cases are all connected to a huge case. 
So it's not one of those anime series based on random cases but there's actually a connection between each case which eventually leads to the master case which is revealed towards the end. 
I've gotta to say I didn't realized until a few episodes later that the murder cases were somewhat related. 
 
The art is pretty cool and do I need to say more about the story?  
You can already tell that I enjoyed the series. 
 
If you're a huge fan of horror/puzzle type of anime series, this is the series for you.

","*This review contains spoilers 
 
It begins like this: A woman, covered in blood, is walking through a dark maze of alleyways. She's pursued by a little boy in a dark cloak, and a ghostly young girl in a white kimono. As the boy and girl corner the injured woman, they're momentarily obscured by a patch of shadows, and when they step out into the light on the other side, they've somehow become older; the little boy is now a tall, intimidating man, and the young girl is now a striking silver-haired teen. None of this is particularly new for the horror genre, but it's executed well enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented. 
 
That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest. The man in the black cloak used a magical staff to blast it with fire, burning it to death and searing off the front of his companion's kimono in the process. The scene then changed, but not before zooming in for a sexploitive close-up of the female lead's bare breasts. Real classy. I imagine all of this might be somebody's cup of tea, but for me, the fun had ended. 
 
What is this ※interesting§ creation that I've described? Well, it's Kikoushi Enma, a four-part OVA that tries like hell to successfully weave together elements of psychological horror, fantasy, and sexual humor into something worth watching. And if it had a decent story, or characters worth mentioning, it might have even succeeded. Unfortunately neither of those elements are present, and while there's a good artistic effort from Brains Base, and an acceptable musical score, ultimately this OVA's writing drags the entire thing down. 
 
The first episode doesn't waste any time laying the groundwork, and we quickly learn that the man in the black cloak and the woman in the white kimono are Enma and Yukihime, respectively. They've been placed on Earth to destroy demons who possess people. Together with their magical hat friend Chapeauji and their toad-duck-monster friend Kapaeru, they pose as a ※supernatural detective agency§ to draw themselves closer to possible demon-related events. 
 
Two episodes of the OVA are self-contained; one is about a vampire prostitute, and the other is about a doll who kills people. Clearly points for originality are not to be awarded here. I'd also consider it a mistake to place these two episodes back-to-back; they're so incredibly similar, so formulaic, that it feels like the same story being told with a slightly different supporting cast. Discoveries are made at the same rate, the same conversations occur, and plot twists and violent confrontations happen at exactly the same points in each episode. 
 
The third and fourth episodes are paired together, telling the story of a group of people trapped in a house which seems to taunt them with reminders of their checkered pasts, picking them off one by one and turning them against each other as it does so. Again, we're treading pretty familiar ground for horror, and the execution here isn't strong enough to make up for the lack of anything truly new; it's predictable, without suspense, and altogether pretty darn boring to watch. In addition, the shift from violent, gory fare to a sudden unforeseen attempt at less in-your-face psychological horror is totally without tact or subtlety, and it gives the OVA even more of an identity crisis than it already had. These two episodes also make an effort to create tie-ins with the first two by bringing in several recurring characters and attempting to stitch them into the plot. The overall impression is of something crude and clumsy that desperately tries to create continuity when in fact there is none to be found. 
 
The biggest problem with the story as a whole is the lack of not just an overarching plot, but even a basic explanation of what happened to lead us to this point in time. Several ※minor§ details, such as where the demons are coming from, and why it is the job of the dynamic duo Enma and Yukihime to destroy them, are left out. It's tough to care about what is happening, or be intrigued by the actions of the cast, when we're not given any context to work with. In the rare cases where the writers see fit to give us a clue about the nature of the situation, it's normally an outright clich谷. For example, we learn  that the demons ※feed on the darkness in the human heart§ and that ※all humans have darkness within them.§ There are also massive plot holes. I won't spoil it, of course, but suffice to say that at least one major plot point revealed at the end of the fourth episode (which is clearly supposed to be some sort of mind-blowing twist) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the scheme of the OVA as a whole. This is an adaptation, and whether flaws this serious are present in the source material or not is beyond me, but they're definitely present here. 
 
The characters are a perfect match for the story; they're also paper-thin and without any background. By the final roll of the credits, we still don't know who Enma, Yukihime, or any of their supernatural companions are, much less how they know each other or why they're doing what they're doing. They're clearly supernatural themselves, so it would be interesting to know what their motivations are for killing other supernatural beings, and how they feel about it. Unfortunately the OVA never answers these questions. None of the cast members have a single identifiable character trait, so it goes without saying that none of them really develop or have any meaningful interactions with one another. There is some weird unrequited romance between Enma and Yukihime, but it's tough to give them a thought as a couple when they don't even have a leg to stand on as individuals. Helping the main cast's problems along is the fact that they're barely even present in the third and fourth episodes, essentially turning them into a minor sideshow act in their own circus. 
 
The supporting cast isn't much better. The series has a weird habit of throwing random characters into the mix with no introduction or previous knowledge of their existence. For example, in the third and fourth episodes, five characters are trapped in the haunted house. Two of them〞a cop who investigates the doings of Enma and company, and a reporter who does the same〞were present in the first couple episodes. However, the remaining three, a creepy perverted teacher and two young girls (go figure) are just suddenly tossed in for what seems to be no reason other than ※we needed more characters.§ The most interesting character in the entire span of the show is the aforementioned reporter, and several scenes involving her are the closest this OVA ever gets to being genuinely engrossing or suspenseful. 
 
Brains Base as a studio has a good artistic track record, and while this isn't the best I've seen from them, it's more than suitable for the purposes of the OVA. The character designs for the main roles are generally strong and distinctive-looking. The supporting cast members are a little more generic, but certainly not offensive. Where the art really works is in creating a setting and atmosphere; the use of lighting, combined with the backgrounds, is effective in giving the impression of a dark and slummy city district that's the perfect home for modern-day demons to take up residence. The lighting does sometimes cross the thin line between ※atmospherically dark§ and ※too damn dark to see anything,§ as is a common problem with this type of setting in general, but the damage is mostly kept to a minimum. 
 
Music is generally used to a good effect in this OVA. It typically consists of ominous orchestral tunes, spearheaded by traditional Japanese stringed instruments and booming drums. The use of an older style of music in a modern setting works surprisingly well, given the sense that the conflict of Enma-and-company vs. demons is an ancient one. Sometimes the soundtrack hurts for variety, as most of the songs sound pretty similar to one another. However, the music is used sparsely enough that this doesn't hurt my impression of it overall. In the grand scheme, it's not a great soundtrack by any stretch, but it's a much better one than the story really warrants, and along with the art, it's definitely one of the stronger aspects of the OVA. 
 
In terms of the spirit of the whole production, the best thing I can compare this OVA to is not other anime, but live-action films in the vein of the ※Friday the 13th§ franchise. There's lots of bad jokes, mindless gore and violence, and a pointless emphasis on sex that might entertain the more animal part of the human brain. If that sounds good to you, then pick this one up, because it won't disappoint you in those regards. But anyone seeking a strong story or memorable characters would be better served looking elsewhere.

          
 
       Helpful Despite several interesting ideas presented and the potential of the story this anime fell flat. In the end it tried to do too many things and consequently did not of them very well.  
 
Story 
My biggest problem is with the story/plot. Kikoushi Enma wanted to be mystery, horror and psychological anime while being deep, funny, touching, scary and a touch sexual all in 4 forty minute episodes. The idea of the darkness in all of us is good but it wasn＊t really developed until the 3rd episode. If that was the ※meaning§ of the OVA it was not a fully formed thought. The demon hunting was again an interesting tease but not really explained. Despite the lack of development the OVA was not confusing 每 just missed potential. 
 
Characters 
Again there was potential for interesting and enjoyable characters, but the character building was abandoned to try and save the plot. The ""main"" characters had personality, although not all ways consistent with the tone of the show, and I would have really liked to see more of them and how they were related which is not explained. 
 
Art/Music 
Both the art and music where pretty decent. The art looked a tad dated/generic, but overall it was solid and little sexy. They made good use of dramatic light and dark contrasts and overall it fit the darker mood of the anime. The music didn't strike me either way really. Overall neither was good enough to compensate for its other short comings. 


          
 
       Helpful Just finished watching, so I thought it was time for a full review. It was a little short, but still a great OVA to watch.  
 
Story: 
 A great little story to watch, It may seem like the classic: Demons appear and all of a sudden a team shows up to combat them, and i guess in a sense that's true, but there is more to it than that. It has a down to earth feel to it. Although you may think pssh superpowers and demons.... how can that be down to earth? Well Although there are superpowers involved, nothing is overly dramatic and over the top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them. All in all, everything is wrapped up pretty nicely and closes off with a somewhat dramatic finale.  
 
8/10 
 
Art:  
 Probably the best part of this entire OVA was the artwork. it builds so much of an atmosphere that pulls the viewer into the environment, experience the emotions of the characters, and the thrill of watching what is unfolding on screen. One thing that was lacking a bit was the artwork of the characters. Don't get me wrong, the characters were decent looking but they weren't anything special. It seems to stand out a bit more when you compare minorly detailed characters with the highly detailed backgrounds. 
 
9/10 
 
Sound: My first impression on this OVA is that probably where this OVA is lacking the most in is sound. I meant that quite literally, there didn't feel like there was that much sounds going on. Actually looking back on it, and re-listening to a couple segments from the episodes i noticed how wrong i was. There is sounds throughout most of the way, but it feels like it has been incorporated so well into the scenery and what is happening that I didn't actually notice. I was drawn so deeply into actual going ons of the scene. The dramatic ominous music, was used throughout, but never overused, and was always changing. the other sounds generally consisted of things like characters breathing loudly, screams, and the scenery. I thought that this just added to the dark and ominous atmosphere that was created throughout. Although you could argue well.... there is not too much background music, and there isn't even an opening. I would agree with most of that. There isn't much background music, but it is well placed. However the lack of an opening, and the kinda lousy ending song were a bit of a disappointment. Ranking this OVA purely based on sound, its kind of low, in that it although it builds up the atmosphere very well, stand alone the sounds are quite generic. 
 
6/10 
 
Characters:  
One thing about this OVA that i was not overly fond of.  The main three characters seemed somewhat one dimensional, and we barely learned nearly anything about them. Little to no character development. Motivation- nada, backstories- nada, how they got their powers- nada. Those characters were a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand however the ""mortal"" characters whom the stories revolved around,we had a little bit more information about them. The characters were a bit better introduced and we  learn more about them, but even then, we still only scratch the surface. Overall the largest flaw of the OVA 
 
Enjoyment: 
I found this OVA to be very enjoyable. I found myself constantly leaning forward towards my computer screen just being engrossed into the story. I honestly didn't notice the 40 min time of each episode until i finished it. Well worth the watch 
 
9/10 
 
Overall: 
I do recommend this to most people. Although there is a slight bit of nudity, and ecchi scenes, nothing is over the top and it really doesn't take anything away from what the storyline does so well to build up. If you can find the time (and i am sure you can) i suggest you to check it out.

16,1505,95,3.867211705,Detective and his or her helper,Detective Conan Movie 09: Strategy Above the Depths,"Fifteen years ago in a barren stretch of the Pacific, a cruise ship collided with an iceberg and was lost at sea. More than a decade later, Hideto Yashiro〞a ship engineer〞died in a fatal car accident. The unlikely connection between these events only comes to light on the luxury liner St. Aphrodite during her maiden voyage. 
 
Aboard it on a much needed vacation, Kogorou Mouri, his daughter Ran, Conan Edogawa, and the Detective Boys enjoy a trip provided by Sonoko Suzuki's family. But their fun is soon cut short when a game of hide-and-seek leads to Sonoko's disappearance. Some time later, the CEO of the Yashiro group, who built the St. Aphrodite, is found stabbed to death and her father missing. While the police's investigation turns to a dead end, Conan closes in on the culprit. Unwilling to be apprehended, the culprit threatens to blow up the St. Aphrodite and sink all her passengers. 
 
As the ship's hull rapidly fills with water, the truth behind the vengeful murders is finally revealed. With no place to escape, Conan and Kogorou must wrestle with the elusive culprit before everyone on board is dragged to the ocean floor. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']","The 9th annual Detective Conan film sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a ""gold medal"" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.
It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogoro, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more guilty she became. As Kogorou and Conan began to evacuate, they found out that Ran was missing. They find her under the deck of the boat with the help of a fire axe. Afterwards a helicopter comes and picks them up. At the post credits, Conan explained he knew where Ran was because when he kicked the volleyball, Ran said she heard a soccer ball, meaning she was in a place with a tough wall. The detective kids come, and told Ran they made a better ""gold medal"" for her, and put it on her.
","It's kind of funny how most Detective Conan movies I remember not liking back then end up becoming one of my favorites now. The same can be said for Detective Conan: Strategy Above the Depths, a movie that started off as one of my least favorites and then ending up as one that I really like. 
 
Before I begin, I should at least bring up one of the reasons I didn't like this movie so much. The version that I saw had the most atrocious translation of all the movies. I found out that the reason it's so bad was because the movie was translated from Japanese to Arabic and then from Arabic to English. This criticism carries on into this review as no other version of this movie is available with better subtitles. It's the only thing keeping me from recommending this movie to other people. 
 
That said, I'm glad that this movie tried to make Kogoro a little more competent than he usually is. It's nice to see him get some action besides Conan. I also liked how the culprit was handled in this movie. We actually got to see him carry out the crime all while trying to keep his innocence. The only thing that I could complain about is Ran's reason to go back and get a special item she forgot, especially given the circumstance she was in at the time. No rational human being would ever do something like that in that situation! Over than that, this movie looks really great. After watching Jolly Roger in the Deep Azure and Requiem of the Detectives, I was relieved to see some kind of quality being put into the art and animation. It was like someone took the art style of early 2000's Conan and made it shine like the top of the Chrysler building. This movie is just so good to look at. 
 
While I wouldn't personally recommend this movie to everybody, I'm glad that I enjoyed it this time. If you can get past the garbage subtitles, then what you will be left with is a very fun movie.

For Mashiro, however, serialization is just the first step. Having promised to marry his childhood sweetheart and aspiring voice actress, Azuki Miho, once his manga gets an anime adaptation, Mashiro must continue his to popularize Ashirogi's work. A tremendously competitive cast of ambitious mangaka〞including the wild genius, Eiji Niizuma; the elegant student, Yuriko Aoki, and her older admirer and partner, Takurou Nakai; the lazy prodigy, Kazuya Hiramaru; and the abrasive artist, Shinta Fukuda〞both support and compete against Muto Ashirogi in creating the next big hit. 
 
As they adjust to their young and seemingly untested new editor, the dynamic duo struggle to maintain their current serialization, secure the top stop in Shounen Jack, and ultimately, achieve an anime adaptation of their manga. With new rivals and friends,  Bakuman. 2nd Season  continues Takagi and Mashiro's inspiring story of hard work and young love. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","When Moritaka Mashiro, a middle school student, forgets his notebook in class, he finds his classmate, Akito Takagi, who notes Mashiro's drawings. Takagi asks him to become a manga artist to his stories. However, Mashiro declines, citing his late manga artist uncle, who died from overworking. Takagi incites Mashiro to meet with Miho Azuki, Mashiro's crush, and tells her the two plan to become manga artists. In response, Azuki reveals her plans to be a voice actress. Mashiro proposes to her that they should both marry when Azuki becomes a voice actress for the anime adaptation of their manga. She accepts, but under the condition that they not meet face-to-face again until then. The two boys then start creating manga, under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, in hopes of getting serialized in Weekly Sh身nen Jump.
After submitting many one-shots to Shueisha, Ashirogi begin their first serialized manga in Weekly Sh身nen Jump, Detective Trap (疶抻仈RAPㄗ亢凶氏化中玄仿永皿ㄘ, Gitantei Torappu), which is eventually canceled due to its declining popularity, after Mashiro is hospitalized for overworking on it. Their next series is the gag manga Vroom, Tanto Daihatsu (軗木!湮逃正件玄, Hashire! Daihatsu Tanto), which they give up on, realizing it will never be popular, coupled with Takagi's difficulty with writing rapid-fire humor. After being challenged by the editor-in-chief of Jump to create a superior manga to their rival's, Ashirogi develops their current series Perfect Crime Party (PCP -俇奐詰齔-, PCP -Kanzen Hanzait身-). It is met with considerable popularity but due to its theme, is unfit for an anime series. When their rival, Eiji Nizuma, submits a one-shot for serialization, Ashirogi competes by submitting Reversi which replaces Perfect Crime Party while the latter is moved to Shueisha's fictional monthly magazine, Hisshou Jump. After many conflicts involving the graphic novel sales and the voice actress choice, Reversi is chosen for an anime adaptation with Miho as the primary actress, after she passes a public audition. After fulfilling their dreams, the series ends with Mashiro officially proposing to Miho at the place they made their promise, the front gate of Miho's old home, followed by their first kiss.
","And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto! 
 
LA will say it here and now just to get this out of the way, Bakuman. 2nd Season had exceeded LA's expectations as well as raze LA's worries and problems that Bakuman had in it's first season and THEN SOME, it's amazing...and ""near masterpiece"" of anime about a duo trying to be the best in the mangaka industry. 
 
LA would at the very least start with their trials and tribulations that Ashirogi Muto goes through, from changing editors, tenser rivalry, getting sick, complacency and honing their skills. Ashirogi Muto goes through A LOT of trials, but not just in the manga field, Mashiro and Takagi BOTH goes through some romantic high and lows as well. Let's begin with the first thing that occurs in this second season, mainly being Ashiorgi Muto changing editors from Hattori to Miura. This affects Ashirogi Muto in alot of ways, mainly for them to switch their preferred genre of making manga from their usual serious and tense manga to what Miura likes...as in gag manga. This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all. 
 
 Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it. 
 
Bakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!. 
 
Bakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way. 
 
In terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman. 
 
The animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great ""in-universe manga details"" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected. 
 
Without a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a ""near masterpiece"" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these ""characters"" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime? 
 
LA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!

          
 
       Helpful I have just dropped after completing episode 6. I enjoyed season 1, although not spectacular, it was a story with meaning. it was about two friends with a shared goal struggling for their dreams. The downside was the love interest, lets get together after we succeed. In my mind a relationship is tested with the lows more then the highs, struggle together surely. But i believed this was more to do with culture, my own being wildly different to the protagonists. 
 
Season 2 started up OK, i didn't understand why they would change the editor. The new assistants while not good were not bad either, flavorless is what comes to mind. Where i object is the hospitalization and this absolute obsession with work and the handling of it. Hes collapsed while in hospital, clearly in pain and his love interest objects to a nurse being called and hands him his markers. His uncle died of overwork, surely he should know better then anyone that health matters. Maybe if i were 10 years younger i could overlook this, but as an adult it doesn't sit right with me.

          
 
       Helpful Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second. 
 
The first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story. 
The second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12 episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside. 
 
Art I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end. 
 
Sound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about. 
 
Character, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = = 
 
Enjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again. 
 
Overall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is. 
 
Those who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too. 
 
Those who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed. 
 
Those who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.

","I'm a fan of Detective Conan and I have to say honestly Detective Conan is a love story rather than detective novel.But Crossroad in the Ancient Capital tells something more than love.Among all the Detective Conan movies,this piece should be one of the best. 
  This time the case happened in Kyoto--former capital of Japan before Tokyo,so this movie is full of Japanese culture:Kendo(耋),Kabugi(貉敃撚).Also there are Japanese history and places of interest of Tokyo.In a word his movie opens a window to Japanese culture.If you are curious about or interested in the country of Japan,you must not miss it! 
  Besides culture stuffs,the theme song by Mai Kuraki is another highlight. 


          
 
       Helpful I'm a fan of Detective Conan and I have to say honestly Detective Conan is a love story rather than detective novel.But Crossroad in the Ancient Capital tells something more than love.Among all the Detective Conan movies,this piece should be one of the best.

       Helpful I give this movie a 7/10. It was good and had a good plot.  
However, I thought of this movie as more of a 2 hour special episode. Nothing in this movie seems as though it is a movie. For a Detective Conan movie there is a case that has to be solved and then something more drastic happens. For example, Movie 01, Conan solves the mystery of the culprit who planted bombs around their area, then it turns out he plants a bomb in a skyscraper where Ran is located and Conan must now go save her. This movie does not have that, being filled with investigation for almost the whole movie and capturing the culprit.

","This has to be my least favorite Detective Conan film. The film focuses far too much in the romance aspect than necessary. I understand the film is called Crimson Love Letter but I found the romance to be boring and typical. There is no point in exploring the Heiji and Kazuha yet unexpressed love story because we know they are not going to confess in this film. The subplot with Heiji and Momiji went nowhere as expected. The side characters such as Mikiko Hiramoto were not used to their full capacity. Also, there seems to be less detective work in this movie than usual. Conan uses his advanced technology like his criminal tracking glasses to do the easy lifting for him. The turbo engine  skateboard ruins the usual suspense by having Conan use force to get out of situations rather than using his head to come up with something clever. This seems like a mediocre product put out for the sake of putting a new Detective Conan movie out every year.  

          
 
       Helpful I'm very surprised this movie is getting so much love. I found it to be one of the worst DC movies in a while. The mystery was boring, regardless of whether you knew Karuta. You could see a lot of the plot twists coming from a mile away. It felt like a mystery they could have told in the anime with 2 episodes. The heavy focus on Heiji and Kazuha was completely  unnecessary. Any DC fan knows that their romance was never going to develop in any meaningful way in any movie. As usual, the action scenes were also longer than they need to be. The animation was also sub-par. It was particularly disappointing considering some of the other movies have done a much better animation job. The only other movies I can think of that were worse are The Raven Hunter, and The Last Wizard of the Century

          
 
       Helpful I came to this movie hoping to like it. When I first saw this movie, I really didn't understand it very well and ended up not enjoying it as much. But after re-watching Zero the Enforcer and loving it, I thought that maybe this time I'll love this film as well. But alas, that day will have to wait as Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter struggles to keep its audience engaged and ends up becoming a very hard to follow film. 
 
As one will know from the summary alone, the film centers on Kazuha competing for Heiji's love in a game of Karuta, an ancient Japanese sport where players must swipe a card that is called out by a speaker. From what I can gather, it's like Bingo, except more aggressive and each card has its own poem associated with it. Since I knew this much, the Karuta games never bothered me that much this time around. 
 
What does bother me is that almost all of the movie-original characters are very forgettable. With the exception of Momiji, the girl Kazuha is competing against, I couldn't recall any of the other characters involved in this movie. This is a real shame as this is supposed to be a mystery film and remembering who the suspects are and what they did is crucial for the audience to become involved in it. Easily the weakest link in this film. 
 
That said, it's not a terrible movie. The art is fantastic and is still one of the best looking movies in the series. The scenes with main cast interacting with each other is still as entertaining as it is in the series. The fact that this is the movie where we are introduced to Momiji for the first time in the series is enough for it to be worth remembered for.  
 
Overall, this isn't a bad movie. It's just not one that I can recommend. Not because I hate it, but because it's too difficult to follow. As such, newcomers are better off watching another(better) movie over this one. But if you already are a fan, just expect to have a trickier time following this one.

16,3079,99,3.644826971,Detective and his or her helper,Aoki Ryuusei SPT Layzner,"The story takes place in an alternate reality based in the year 1996, where humanity is advanced enough to develop long-range space travel, as well as bases on both the Moon and Mars. However, the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have not ended; rather, they've escalated as both sides build military facilities in space, and the shadow of nuclear conflict looms over humanity, both on and off Earth. 
 
Meanwhile, on the Red Planet, an exchange program created by the United Nations to promote peace and understanding is about to begin; the ""Cosmic Culture Club,"" consisting of 16 boys and girls, as well as their instructor Elizabeth, arrives at the UN Mars base. Among the passengers is Anna a 14-year-old girl who serves as the narrator for the story.

The year is 1996.  
 
As the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union continue to escalate, with the conflict having now extended its reach to even the Moon and Mars, another sinister threat begins to emerge in the background. The alien race from Grados begin to take pre-emptive military action to conquer the Earth in an attempt to prevent the ever-spreading threat that it poses from stretching its hand of power to even the farthest confines of the Uldoria system where the Gradosians reside. The impending conflict first makes itself known on the planet Mars where members of the Cosmic Culture Club, an exchange program created by the UN, are currently arriving on the planet. Several large piloted machines appear, caught in the midst of a desperate struggle. These machines called SPTs or Super Powered Tracers are a form of advanced weapons technology that Grados possesses. As the battle quickly results in widespread destruction on the UN Mars base a pilot of one of the SPTs vows to protect the Earth and warn them of the plot that the Gradosians are now endeavoring to make manifest. 
 
His name is Albatro Null Eiji Asuka.  
 
He is a half-Earthling, half-Gradosian hybrid. His father, long thought to be lost in deep space by the Earth, has told him stories of his homeland. Eiji, enamored by these tales and proud of his Earth-based heritage, has pledged to warn those on the blue planet〞a planet that he considers to be his second home〞of the crisis that they now face. But are they even willing to listen? And even if they are, can they stop fighting among one another to face the conflict they are now beset by before it's too late? 
 
Aoki Ryuusei SPT Layzner or Blue Comet SPT Layzner can be cleanly divided into two parts and since they are significantly different from one another I'll refer to them as Part 1 (Episodes 1-24) and Part 2 (Episode 26 onward) within this review (Note: Episode 25 is a recap). The first part feels almost like a love letter to the real robot genre which, by the time Layzner had aired in 1985, had managed to establish that it was here to stay. Layzner, in many instances, very clearly derives inspiration from its predecessors. A number of shout-outs are seemingly given to many of the series that helped in bringing this new era about, at least from what I can see. Don't believe me? Well, I'll point out a few of the most noticeable ones that can be found in the series. The name ""Blue Comet"" is almost definitely a reference of sorts to Char Aznable, whose moniker in Mobile Suit Gundam is the ""Red Comet,"" and the V-MAX system on the Layzner can boost its speed to three times its normal operating output which is highly probable to be another reference to the speed at which Char is said to move in his Mobile Suit. Interestingly, the V-MAX system also seems to have had a significant influence down the road itself as it appears to be very similar to the Trans Am system seen in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. There are certain mecha designs in Layzner that are reminiscent of the Variable Fighters from Super Dimension Fortress Macross. Several character designs and the personality traits of certain characters also seem to be derived from those in a number of prior real robot series as well. Gosterro's counterpart would likely be Quamzin Kravshera of Macross, possessing similar character designs, in addition to both being members of the military, as well as being killers of their own allies. Gresco is similar to Drake Luft from Aura Battler Dunbine, both in design, and in certain personality aspects, too. Eiji's character starts to physically resemble Chirico Cuvie from one of Ryousuke Takahashi's prior works, Armored Trooper Votoms, as the series progresses. Eiji's spacesuit also has a red left shoulder, probably a reference to the Red Shoulders of Votoms (the red is painted on the right side of the mechs in this series). Eiji shares the same voice actor (Kazuhiko Inoue) as the main character from another of Takahashi's prior series, Crinn Cashim from Fang of the Sun Dagram. Ahmos Gale resembles Jean Paul Rochina of Armored Trooper Votoms and serves a somewhat similar purpose to the main character in both series. That's just to name a few. Still, I found it pretty interesting and perhaps you may as well. Part 2 of Layzner, on the other hand, seems to have taken significant inspiration from several films. Perhaps most notable/likely to have influenced Layzner would be The Terminator and Star Wars. There are also very clear instances where it seems to have been influenced by Indiana Jones or horror movies as well. I could be wrong about this one, but the Death Demon Squad also seem to have certain scenes that are lightly reminiscent of elements from A Clockwork Orange. It seems Takahashi is quite the fan of many films as there are often numerous shout-outs to them in the series that he has worked on. Also, and since I haven't seen it I can't say with complete certainty, but based on my very limited knowledge of the series, Part 2 of Layzner may have been partially inspired by Fist of the North Star. 
 
Based on the alternate reality premise of the series one would probably be able to easily assume that there would a commentary on the Cold War within the show. Indeed, this is what is being criticized on the surface. However, Layzner is not only offering a critique of America and the Soviet Union's tension during this time (note as well that the Cold War was still ongoing in 1985 when the series was airing), but perhaps also Imperial Japan in some ways. However, back to the main theme of this show. At its core this series resolutely proclaims its support for mutual understanding and cooperation between all peoples and individuals. There should be no distinction of race (whether human or alien) or country and everyone should be able to help one another as fellow intelligent beings. Right off the bat, the Cold War tension between the two superpowers is immediately called into question when we learn that Eiji is of two different races yet still loves both Grados and the Earth. What it's attempting to say is that despite being of two different places he is still a person, just as even though two countries are two different places they are still all comprised of people, and all people deserve to be treated with respect. Early on, we learn that Eiji has been forced to make the difficult decision of making the trip to Earth, alone, away from his family, while being branded a traitor, to warn the blue planet of the impending crisis that they face.  
 
One of the big ideas in this series is that you should not base your opinion of person on your first impression alone. There is a lot more to them than meets the eye and it repeatedly turns your first impressions of a person around, sometimes multiple times with a single character. This idea applies for the both the characters within the series and for the viewer of the series as well. David's first impression of Eiji is not a positive one at all. It's kind of clever how they make him have a poor first impression of Eiji while simultaneously doing everything they can to try to make the viewer dislike him without leaving the realm of being realistic, only to completely change both impressions as the series progresses. Early in the series David will probably irritate the viewer, but at the same time you should keep in mind that he's young, and that he has just watched his best friend die right in front of him (I don't see people complaining about a character from a certain series that features giants who behaves in a very similar way). After he manages to get past this initial confrontational attitude with Eiji he will become one his most loyal friends, as he comes to understand that Eiji does in fact have the Earth's best interest at heart. After the two manage to come to an understanding their mutual trust in one another is unshakable which applies for the members of the Cosmic Culture Club as well. There is a really heartwarming moment at the end of Episode 26 where the viewer will come to understand just how far David has come as a character. Compare it with his initial behavior towards Eiji and you'd hardly think they were the same person. This scene effectively hammers in the thematic message of the show quite significantly too. With the massive development David undergoes he may actually be the best character of Layzner, only perhaps outmatched by Eiji himself. Another time where your initial perception of a character is likely to flipped over is the whole situation with Rowan. Other examples would include Lieutenant Commander Dannie, Julia, and Gale, to name a few others. Layzner works to show that these characters have more depth to them than being one-note or laden with tropes, and more often than not it succeeds.  
 
Eiji is a pacifist and he abhors killing. So, if you've got a problem with a protagonist like that you may not like him all that much, although I would suggest that you seriously re-evaluate your outlook on life if you think not wanting to take the life of another is a ""bad"" trait to possess. He is rather stoic (Seriously, Chirico, is that you?), and bottles up his feelings quite a bit, but despite this his love for people is undoubtedly one of his shining qualities. He has a pure and noble heart that values all life, and he manages to exemplify true heroism and self-sacrifice. Despite being quite stoic, his emotions do power through in certain scenes. Look at his face when he sees Earth from space for the time; he is visibly moved by the scene, quite possibly even more so than those of the Cosmic Culture Club who are finally within reach of their home. The Layzner machine has an AI installed on it, Rei, with another hidden AI as well, Phoron. Phoron is never referenced again after a certain point (this is different for the extended and somewhat alternate ending in Episode 3 of the OVA version). The AI installed on the Layzner is amoral which at times serves as a source of struggle for Eiji because he does not want to kill. There is a scene where Eiji debates with Phoron that also really helps the advancement of the themes at one point.  
 
As a result of what happens between Part 1 and Part 2 I can't give much of a review of Part 2 without spoiling something big from Part 1, so just be aware of that before proceeding. Part 2 begins after a three year time-skip from Part 1. Before discussing the second part I want to say something about the first part. Humanity, realizing how outmatched and outgunned they are by Grados finally unite as one to wage a battle against them and this can be very hard to take seriously. Even if they face a common enemy would they really be able to unite this easily to face them? Well, considering the thematic heart of the series it wants to believe so and it is probably necessary for this to happen as easily as it does to give those themes that much more power. However, I would have preferred a bit more effort with the writing during this point. It really declines in quality for about two or three episodes. The second part of this series gets really, really dark. Eiji, the members of the Cosmic Culture Club, and the people of Earth have failed to prevent the conquest of Earth by Grados resulting in the Earth being forced into a dystopian nightmare. Grados has culled the population of the Earth, reducing it to a mere fraction of what it once was. A Gradosian weapon capable of destroying the ozone layer leaves cities completely razed. Oppression by the Grados results in routine public executions (even children), torture, the destruction of anything that has to with Earth culture (books, art, film, etc.), brainwashing, forced labor, etc. The Gradosians, thinking themselves a superior entity, reign over the humans of Earth without mercy. A resistance group takes up arms in the hope of revolting against them. Among them are a now more mature David and Anna located in New York. Simone and Arthur are fighting battles in other locations in their own way before they reunite with the group in New York. Dr. Elizabeth is working with the Resistance underground, developing weapons to combat the Gradosians. Eiji finally reappears after three long years and joins the fight with the Resistance. But Rowan has decided to align himself with Grados. The second part of the series is mainly about toppling the Gradosian regime and continuing to advance the themes of the series forward. It also brings back a character who was very clearly dead (and probably should have remained that way) as a cyborg. The second part encounters a number of pacing issues and the production values also take a very noticeable hit at many points as well. Within this part there is some rather impressive depictions of outright insanity and madness though, notably for that cyborg character who I had initially considered to be pretty one-note, but as a result of the way the insanity was depicted it ended up improving my opinion of the quality of the character's writing somewhat. Despite this part being very dark it still has its fair share of heartwarming moments, and really pushes the themes of the series to new levels. 
 
As for the romance in the series, at the beginning I didn't care much for the way it was handled, but like this series has continually proven, I should not base my perception of something on my initial impression alone. There are two romances that are significantly built-up over the course of the series. (They aren't the only two romances though. They're just the ones the viewer would probably be the most ""familiar(?)"" with. (Although I'm not sure if familiar is the best word choice here.)) One of the ways it manages to pull this off is by having the last episode look back at some of the events that led to the conclusion of the series. It is here that the things that I initially thought weren't all that great in regards to the romance suddenly end up being quite a bit more meaningful. Both of the romances in the show have some heartwarming moments to them and by the end I was rather impressed with what one of them had managed to pull off. At one point, one of these characters narrates to another a story related to a flower about a maiden who waits for her lover to return to her for months, and then years. The series manages to pull this off with the time-skip from Part 1 to Part 2, and I was rather pleasantly surprised that it also had significance at another point aside from this one occasion.  
 
Here is some nitpicks that had no impact on my overall score of the series. A minor one I have would be that the language barrier is non-existent. Everyone is able to understand one another easily even though they should be speaking different languages in certain situations. I would assume that English is the language that is primarily spoken in most cases though. In Part 2 one of the characters is reading a book that is formatted right-to-left rather than left-to-right despite taking place in New York. Of course, they are trying to save all the books they can at this point, so I can easily toss this aside as completely insignificant. (I just felt like pointing it out.) Oddly enough, there is another scene where a book is formatted left-to-right, but more often than not they are formatted right-to-left in most scenes.  
 
The battles in the series, while not always being animated the best, are a bit different from what I've typically encountered in other mecha series. This is mainly for one reason only though: the SPTs frequently do these really flashy spins/flips. Additionally, the animation can be rather rigid on occasion or feature a noticeable drop in frame rate. The art utilizes these really vivid color choices. This can be seen pretty clearly on Mars with the red and orange hues of the planet being in the background of the bold, deep blue of the Layzner unit. The Layzner machine typically stands out quite a bit when it's in a scene due to its color, especially when the V-MAX system is activated at which point it effectively gives off the impression of a ""blue comet."" There are a number of cases where there are very obvious off-model drawings for the characters or the backgrounds. Oh, and the opening theme is probably one of the greatest opening themes ever. I can't forget to say that :D  
 
Layzner is quite the underappreciated hidden gem. While it was cancelled, resulting in a mad dash at the end to wrap things up, it is still rather impressive with what it managed to accomplish during the time that it did have. I do have some problems with how certain parts of the series played out, but overall it was handled exceptionally well and I am satisfied with the time I spent watching it. For fans of old real robot mecha series such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Votoms, Macross, and Dunbine I recommend giving Layzner a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised. Layzner, both as the series and as the machine itself, embarks on a journey for the day when all of humanity can reach a mutually beneficial and cooperative relationship with each other. Without a doubt, it's a series with an optimistic outlook, but it also comes across as a solemn prayer for humanity. And as it searches for that day when everyone can understand one another, 
 
The Blue Comet slowly bathes the sky with a glistening light〞a light gently illuminated〞 
 
〞With hope.
