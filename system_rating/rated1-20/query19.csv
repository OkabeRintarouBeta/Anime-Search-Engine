19,32212,0,15.5451174,Anime with an ensemble casts,Ensemble Stars!,"Yumenosaki Private Academy, a school located on a hill facing the ocean. Specializing in boys' idol training, the school has a long history of producing generations of idols for the entertainment world out of the young men overbrimming with talents, like the shining stars in the sky. Due to ""special circumstances,"" you are a transfer student at the school, as well as the only female student there.

(Source: Ensemble Stars! Wikia) ","['Music', 'School']","I would not recommend the Ensemble Stars anime to anyone who is not already acquainted with the characters. 
 
As with most gacha adaptations, the cast is just too big for a first-time viewer to really get attached to them. I don't know how much draw there is for someone not already invested in the boys: The plotline's Kill-la-Kill-meets-idol-boys shtick is entertaining, to an extent, but it takes itself too seriously to really stand out. Additionally, the show is so concerned with giving every boy their screentime that the main story often gets sidelined--or, depending on how you look at it, the show devotes far too much time to the Saturday morning exploits of ""power of friendship!"" Trickstar that fans of other characters or units may be left frustrated. On that note, the show also features episode-long diversions in the plot that can feel completely out of left field. 
 
That said, however, I think this anime adaptation is an absolute treat for anyone who already loves these characters. I have a blast watching new boys show up and bounce off of one another. The show plays up the quirks of its wackier characters in ways that the game and the manga can't quite convey--like Shinobu's constant scrambling and mumbling, Kanata and Mika's adorably odd speech patterns, or the pure visual comedy of Rei scrolling through his social media feed from the inside of his coffin--and it's just a joy to watch. Really, this anime functions more as a fun little companion piece to the game than a strong standalone show. 
 
The art direction and animation are nothing to write home about. There are a couple of faster-moving scenes that are granted a couple more frames' attention (the fight between Koga and Kuro in episode 1 or 2 comes to mind) but even that's pretty standard, comparatively. The interchanging use of both hand-drawn and 3D animation during live performances is a little jarring, but the 3D models are kind of cute, so I don't mind as much. Speaking of the lives, I found the songs the characters performed to be quite catchy, and they stand out quite nicely from the show's regular soundtrack (and the OP, unfortunately). The ED also features interchanging songs from different units that are always a nice treat. It's still one of those ""nice if you already like idol songs/J-pop"" things, I guess. 
 
TL;DR Ensemble Stars is a mediocre, skippable anime, but if you play the game or even just know about the characters in passing from your Tumblr mutual or something it's good fun. 

          
 
       Helpful For you to truly love this Anime, you must be obsessed with discovering Anime characters more than anything else in Anime. The story is good but doesn't have much to it, it's normal. However, you will love this anime if you came to love the characters in it. The characters' personalities, and their appearance, meaning the art and the music in it are the strong points of this anime which can make you like it.  
 
Ensemble Stars is not like any other idol's anime, as it focus mainly on some characters' stories, and sometimes a group of characters together, rather than focusing on a definite story or songs in general. 
 
 
So my overall rating is 7, fairly Good. I enjoyed this anime though I can say not all episodes are equal in preference as some I enjoyed a lot, some were just fine and others were quite normal. But overall I loved most of the characters which made me enjoy watching the anime. Besides, while watching the last episode, there were some tears in my eyes for knowing this is the last moment having memories with these characters whom I loved.. 
 


          
 
       Helpful First, I apologize for my bad english (frenchie desu) 
 
As others people said in their reviews, I would not recommend it if you are not familiar with the game, I feel like if I wasn't familiar with the universe, I would be really lost when watching the anime. 
 
It's kinda sad but I feel like the anime is rushed and I think it's a shame because EnStars has such a good story and deserve better. 
 
From some rumors, I heard there will be 24 (or more) episodes and I honestly think it would have deserved more if they wanted to develop the plot better. 
 
Each characters are really well writed and it's not easy to get to know each of them because there are a lot and the anime rush so much that we don't have time to focus on them. 
 
Plus, I was really happy that Anzu got to be in the anime but I feel like she's not really important in the anime and that really bothers me because in the game she IS really important and way more devolopped. 
 
I don't hate the anime at all and still really happy that we finally get it but i'm a little disapointed, our boys deserved better and i'm sad I can't really show it to my friends to introduce them into EnStars because they will surely be lost in no time.

19,103,2,12.54235186,Anime with an ensemble casts,Akazukin Chacha,"Akazukin Chacha is the story of a young magical girl (Mahō Shōjo) named Chacha. Living with her guardian in a cottage on Mochi-mochi mountain is Seravi, who is her teacher and also the fictional world's greatest magician. Chacha is clumsy in casting her spells because, throughout the anime, when she summons something, it often turns out to be something that she didn't mean to cast, for example, spiders (kumo) instead of a cloud (also kumo). At times in the anime when she and her friends are in trouble, however, her spells do work. Living on the same mountain is a boy gifted with enormous strength named Riiya. It is described that Riiya came from a family of werewolves who can instantly change into a wolf whenever they want. Quite far from Mochi-mochi mountain lies Urizuri mountain. Dorothy, also a well known magician in her land, lives in a castle on Urizuri mountain. Living with her is Shiine, her student. Shiine is adept when it comes to casting spells. He is a young wizard and most of his knowledge about magic was taught to him by Dorothy. 
 
The first 2 seasons were originally created by the anime team. Most of the stories in season 3 are based on the manga.

I'll never forget it, it came on every day on Cartoon Network, IN ENGLISH DUB (If you can believe that) 
 
The characters are unique! Like for instance, there is a teacher with a whip who will whip the kids if they are bad or mess up (It's not sad, it's done in a comical way). 
 
The story is pretty unique, but isn't the greatest; but it's a lot better than the Manga (Both versions differ in story, yet the Anime adaptation takes place at a school of magic! ^_^) 
 
The theme song is unforgettable! 
 
And the art is great (For it's time)! 
 
Over all I say try to find this rare anime and watch it! 
 
Although you may not be able to find the English dub (It's impossible, I've tried), and you will not be able to purchase this (A DVD set was only released in Japan), If you find it watch it!!!! 
 
Trust me the Japanese version may appeal to you more (Since you have no choice, cause the English dub isn't any where to be found). 
 
Hope you enjoy it just as I enjoyed it as a little girl! ^_^

          
 
       Helpful There aren't many reviews for this show, so here's another. 
This is a pure comedy, so the story isn't really a focus in any way, but let's cover everything: 
 
Storyline wise, Akazukin Chacha, or ""Little Red Riding-Hood"" Chacha, is decent at best. Over the course of the series itself, it attempts to construe a vague, generic demon-king versus royal family/heroes of the land type of story. And it does a very good job of achieving what it set out to do, which is to both have an excuse to fight enemies over the course of the show, and to cause conflict during the episodes, giving the characters something to react to. - 4 
 
Art in the show is arguably pretty good for the date and presumable budget. It takes a lot of money to make animation, and it's artwork is at a far better level of quality than some more popular anime that came out even a year or two later. (Detective Conan, for example). And it's about equal to others, like Dragonball. 
That said, it's nothing special. They did a very good job at distinguishing characters, but really they only animated the ones from the manga. It's obvious they made a good effort for comedic impact, though. Who can forget Principal Urara's eyes? - 6 
 
For sound, we have some adequate background music, nothing too memorable. It plays in the correct moments and doesn't feel contrived, so there's that. There are also the highlights like the ""Team Theme"" and the ""Panda Song"". The opening and ending songs are another story, and are excellent pieces of music. Both the opening, which never changes, and the latter two endings are catchy, fun and upbeat, all in a good way, just like the show's tone. The second ending is especially good, and extremely catchy, definitely worth listening to on an MP3 player. - 7 
 
The characters are a strong point of this anime. You have the blunt, selfish and frankly ""beepy"" (Think Ayumi from Conan or Hikase from Nichijou) Chacha herself, who the show would suffer a lot from without. Though that would go for most show's main characters, heh. Her lines, reactions, blunt and selfish verbal assaults are honestly some of the funniest parts of the show. If you don't like her, which I find really hard to believe, (maybe you just don't understand how she is and think she's coming off as annoying? I pity you if so), chances are you won't like the rest of the show. 
 
The brave, always hungry and a little dense, werewolf Riiya. His voice actor (someone from a boy band) did a great job, and suited him like no one else ever could have, making him sound at varying times energetic, a little slow on the uptake, lazy, cowardly, and bold.  
 
The wizard in training, the good boy Shiine-chan. (Soujiro and Sera Masumi in the Kenshin and Conan anime series, respectively), is always hilarious. From his vain attempts to show off in hopes of impressing Chacha, his love for work and study, his secret perverted ways, and his adorably-embarrassed side, you'll probably come to like Shiine-chan. 
 
Then there's Seravy-sama, the greatest wizard in the world. He's humorously superior, lacks common sense sometimes, and has a big thing for blonde curly hair and his favorite doll, which might actually be alive, Lizbeth. 
From his ""just-passing-through"" disguises (""I'm only a just-passing-through master pastry chef!""), to his slightly negligent but mostly responsible upbringing of Chacha, and the way they fit each other like a glove, he's a very likable, enjoyable character that'll have you laughing along with his antics. 
 
The rest of the characters, Yakko, Marin, Orin, Rascal-sensei (Kindaichi from Kindaichi Case Files), are all characterized well and have matching seiyuu. In fact, I can't think of one seiyuu that doesn't fit their role perfectly, and they all seemed to have fun with the show, too, which is another pro. The crew got lucky with the cast, for sure. - 8 
 
The real enjoyment are the jokes. There's slapstick humor, sure, and plenty of it, but the most hilarious part is the interactions between the characters and the way they react to things. If seeing Chacha tear up because Riiya accidentally called her a fool, and then in the next episode turn around and insult both of her friends like it was perfectly natural like the comicly selfish person she is, or watching kids get drunk and summoning a bunny-dragon to take down the bad guys, or finding out Chacha can rewind and playback memories in slow motion (that was a classic), is not your idea of humor, then the show probably isn't for you. 
If it is, though, you'll find it absolutely hilarious, because it does an outstanding job at that specific type of humor. - 10 
 
Overall I give this series an 8.

Each of these was infinitely less exciting than the current Animation Age! In this RPG-esque existence, becoming stronger is paramount to one's survival and leveling up is a must. From pacifists to news casting, from fishing woes to love advice, there's nothing the Animation Age can't show or teach us about life in a game world!

(Source: Anime-Planet)","['Fantasy', 'Game', 'Comedy']","Comedy is such a broad genre. It can be slapstick, it can be subtle, it can be dark, it can be most anything you want it to. As it stands, this form of comedy, which I will call sketch comedy from now on, is something I have had little interaction with so far (in the anime world that is). And as such, it dawns on me that this review will be exceedingly hard... or maybe exceedingly simple depending on your point of view. This is because, Master of Epic... or sketch comedies in general, only have one real requirement... Comedy. Characters are there, but don't really need much personality. They usually have one simple trait for the sketch they are involved in. And plot is basically non existent. So its hard to rate something like this (if I'm trying to be as un-biased as possible), when comedy is purely based on the viewer in question. But I will try my best: 
 
Mast of Epic: The Animation Age is an anime based on a Japanese MMORPG called... well Master of Epic. The game hasn't been released outside of Japan so don't bother looking for it. This anime was made really to promote the game itself, and so is quite good in explaining small facets of the game itself. At the beginning of every episode a small explanation is given of a certain game trait, and the rest of the episode tends to be kind of themed around that first point. Also after every skit, a little ""the more you know"" style factoid will pop up and explain a little something from the previous skit. As an advertisement agent, this thing is actually quite effective... But considering you probably have no way of getting the game, thats not really a big point is it... How does the humor hold up eh? Wellll... 
 
Master of Epic does quite well in the humor department. Although it is based on one particular MMORPG, it does a very good job of satirizing many of the small idiosyncrasies common to most RPG's. Some examples include going AFK, being resurrected from death, random monster spawn, combat and non-combat skills etc etc. It has some other jokes too, but really you will probably want to be somewhat of an RPG fan... or at least understand RPGs to find a lot of this funny. Still, as a fan myself, I found the humor to be quite simple but effective. 
 
Ummmm and that's it really. The music isn't that great, but the art is pretty good for a little known show like this.  Its sad to see that so few people have managed to find this little gem, because its really quite good. As a sketch comedy, I honestly can find nothing wrong with it. Characters are simple but memorable enough, the comedy is funny, there are 7 or 8 repeating sketches that you can enjoy every time they come back. All in all, if you like RPGs, and like this kind of un-connected random comedy, then you'll definitely like Master of Epic. 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I personally watched the hell out of it a few times already, but this show is utter garbage. The characters are flat one dimensional, even when they are portraying different archetypes of people you encounter in  games. 
 
The show is set as skits, and they are very nonsensical, and they draw on the nonsense to go about getting you to laugh, I didn't laugh much at the skits and their premises much, however, they did have one segment i enjoyed a lot and those where wenever the Waragetcha 5 showed up. 
 
The art... honestly is pretty bland, definitely felt like a low budget anime, but then again when i did check out the game the anime was promoting... the art style matched the game well. 
 
Music was not really worth mentioning as it wasn't really memorable... maybe except the intro to the waragetcha 5 only because it is such a self poking song. 
 
All in all, the humor and the premise of this show caters a really narrow number of people, and i can't say i know people who could enjoy this show... unless they are into bad gags and some weird slapstick comedy. The show doesn't take itself seriously, almost as if it knows it's bad, which is probably what drew me into watching the show...  having a feeling that the staff did the show just for the giggles.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Supernatural', 'Magic', 'Fantasy']","I was expecting quite a lot from this anime, and I didn't get it. The characters are attractive, the story sounded interesting enough on paper, but it just lacked style. Some of the scripting is so forced and unrealistic that it just makes you squirm with embarrassment. And the fight scenes...erm...they got glossed over. The scenarios and the plot were far too &quot;convenient&quot;, pushing the bishounen characters into situations where they could touch each other endearingly (aka inappropriately, yahoo!) and struggle with their inner most feelings (aka lots of angst). 
Saint Best is a bishounen-fest. There isn't really much else to recommend it. There are only ( I think) 2 female characters in it; a goddess who seems to need her strapping lads to do everything for her and a midget angel that bounces about thinking she's being very cute (aka putting &quot;dechu&quot; on the end of every sentence - argh!) 
If you're happy with just looking at the characters (lets be fair, they do look nice) then go for it, but I recommend turning off the audio and subs, because otherwise you'll spend a lot of time cringing.

          
 
       Helpful Don't expect more than light shounen-ai fluff out of this one -- you'll be disappointed. Story-wise, there isn't much to see here. The first few episodes are monster of the day type encounters that are supposed to give us some insight into the main characters (while simultaneously placing them in position to be slashed with each other.) The story picks up in the last two episodes, at which point it promptly ends without actually coming to a conclusion. The action is scant, and consists mainly of posed characters dashing across the screen making slashing attacks that do more damage to clothing than to anything else. That is, of course, when they bothered animating the action at all. In several instances the fighting takes place off screen, while the other characters comment on the battle. This ended up being very irritating; luckily, there's hardly any fighting that doesn't start and end in an energy blast after the second episode. 
 
The characters themselves, while terribly attractive, aren't anything special. They follow standard bishounen archetypes: Gou is the strong-willed, stoic leader, Shin the quiet, wise one (and he's got the spectacles to prove it,) Rei is bizarrely effeminate and sensitive, and young Gai is the head-strong, childish type. There isn't sufficient back-story to make any of the characters particularly sympathetic, and the attempts at placing them in relationships are weak and somewhat tawdry. ""One time he was nice to me!"" *blush*  
 
I wanted more out of this series, especially with such a great cast and an appealing premise (I get a kick out of angelic pretty boys,) but I was left unsatisfied. If you happen to have exhausted your supply of bishounen lovin' and need some RIGHT NOW, go ahead and give this a gander. Otherwise, move along. Nothing to see here.

These helped to change the animation style and helped the stories as well. You may not understand what is going on unless you watch Pandora and episode 0 (where oragon comes back). 
The first season struggled with episode length. While an episode was 8 minutes, the show only had 6 minutes of runtime, with 2 minutes of nonsense. While the anime progressed, the length increased from 8 minutes to 13, however, there was still a lot of nonsense after an episode ended.  Season 2 seems to have changed this and almost the entire episode is an episode (compare season 1 ep 1, and season 2 ep 1, and you'll understand what I mean. 
The anime style has completely changed from the first season. Usually, movie animations are crisper, which is fine for a short amount of time. However, the entire season has a crisp feel to it, and it can become hard to watch.  
With the end of season 1, I was sure XFLAG didn't have more content to deliver. However, I a happy to have been proven wrong. Season 2 adds more characters, more monsters, and a new storyline that blend smoothly with the first season. There is now time for character development, and it is very enjoyable.  
The first season did a great job of breaking the 4th wall, but it would get really annoying at times (again, more nonsense). The second season, on the other hand, has limited the breaking of the wall to a minimum, which is a huge plus.  
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. Other reviews across the internet tend to bash this anime. The issue is that those reviewers played the game before the anime came out, and it didn't live up to their expectations. I still have not played the game, so I really enjoy this anime. I would personally recommend watching season 1 and the OVAs, before playing the monster strike game. But that's just my honest opinion.

Also, surprisingly I enjoyed it because of the various guests that I recognized. That and the casting (popular actors) that's involved. 
However let's cut to the chase here. This anime was a 4/10, maybe at best 5/10 in overall. With such minimum enjoyment, it's something I wouldn't re-watch or recommend at all. 
 
Story - 5.  
Being slightly misled by the first episode but that was probably to built some extra atmosphere for the rest. It doesn't keep the same expectation afterwards. Obviously there's really no story but just ""gags"". Only one part had me sincerely laughing which was the ""shit"" otome visual novel part.  
 
Art/Sound - 5.  
Yes, it's neon purple and it's even been simplified to literal 1-D once. It made up for some random CGs / change of pace to ""freshen"" it up throughout the series. If it was left as it is, this could've been less than a 4.  
Forget the music, except the one part that caught me off-guard being ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"", very unexpected and pleasant. 
 
Character - 4. 
Not much to say, it's just simply gag-repetition per character. [Although I've enjoyed seeing guests being included in the series, a minority does not represent the majority. I would give it a 6 for this though.] 
 
It might not be my cup of tea and definitely not a personal recommendation, I guess it's something you can ""try"" regardless. 

          
 
       Helpful Don't base your commitment to watch the entire series on the unrepresentative first episode: If you came here expecting a spiritual successor to Osomatsu-san, you will be sorely disappointed. Both Shinya Tensai Bakabon and Osomatsu-san may be modern reinterpretations of Fujio Akatsuka's classic works, but Bakabon completely fails to catch Osomatsu's momentum, insultingly incapable of recreating its wit or boldness. 
 
An overwhelming number of skits has the main characters stubbornly resist to come up with jokes or situations where something funny could happen. Instead, they sit around spitballing what they could do this episode, only to reject each other's lazy ideas by saying they'll get in trouble with the broadcaster. This would be a little less inexcusable if this was a 10-minute improv format like gdgd Fairies/gd Men. Referential humor is a debatable topic, but even if you like it, you'll get sick and tired of the characters constantly breaking the 4th wall by calling out that they're only tiptoeing around a reference without committing to it. It's as if Family Guy was about to make one of their infamous manatee jokes, but before they can even cut to the unrelated scene, someone interrupts and yells ""No we can't do that on tv!"". The characters also often address that the show has no budget, that they don't want to animate anything, that their broadcasting station is shit, and that they don't expect people to watch it anyway - and that's usually supposed to be the whole punchline. Similarly, when a famous voice actor shows up, the punchline is always the heavy lampshading of the cameo, and that it serves no other purpose other than having the voice actor on the show at all (paraphrased: ""Hello I am indeed THE famous Hiroshi Kamiya, hey wait why is my cameo already over???""). 
The writers probably couldn't come up with proper comedy situations because they kept the characters from 50 years ago as-is, instead of reinventing them like they did it with the formerly indistinguishable sextuplets from Osomatsu-kun. Worst of all: The two most flanderized characters, Bakabon's Papa and Mr. Policeman, take up the majority of the screen time while (slightly) more versatile characters like Bakabon, Mama and Hajime hardly ever show up at all. Even Eeldog shows up relatively rarely, even though he is the only designated straightman to Bakabon's Papa's stupidity. 
 
In summary, Shinya Tensai Bakabon is an offensively pointless, self-referential comedy about outdated caricatures that relies too much on 4th wall breaking and nostalgia for an era that almost nobody in the Western anime community can relate to.

          
 
       Helpful Such an underrated show in my opinion. The fact that it has a 5 rating (which I agree with in certain terms) makes me sad, and the fact that almost no one watched it makes me sad as well. 
 
Was this show an amazing show which doesn't deserve the score at all? I would so about 20% no, the other 80% says Yes. The series is legit just dumb fun. It makes meta jokes and constant dirty humor. However I think the show accomplished what it set out to do. To be just plain stupid. Honestly the about of screenshots of the dumb shit the characters say in the show is way to much.  
 
Honestly this might just not be your kind of humor and you just might find it annoying, weird, and say to yourself wtf is this then I don't blame you. However I do think this series is something worth giving a try and seeing if you might like it or not, because I tried it and I loved it.

Joy!,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","I'm not going to tell you what the special is about, because you could just find that on the synopsis. This special was dull. First off, it was only four minutes. They should've made it into a  Christmas themed episode, not just four minutes of characters saying what they like about Christmas. Second off, all the dialogue for the characters, other than the FFF (those guys who are dressed in the black KKK outfits) who's responses vary on the character, is EXACTLY THE SAME! For example, when Himeji said what she liked about Christmas, they said that Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Christ, not love. On the other hand, when Hideyoshi said the SAME EXACT THING, they said, ""HIDEYOSHI PLEASE DATE ME!!!"" And the pattern goes on like that. It's not really worth your time, but if you're obsessed with Baka and Test then you might want to watch it.

Overall, it's a fair-to-middlin' movie, with a story and animation that is aimed squarely at the pre-teen audience.  Even though this is billed as an 'anime' movie, most movies that were created in this time period still had a very heavy Disney influence and did not contain many (if any) of the normal anime tropes and quirks we are used to from today's anime offerings.

I haven't watched it since then, and was recently reminded of it, so I watched it again and wondered what the hell the people were on when they made this!!! Apart from the epic backing music, the storyline is crazy and sometimes you're left watching the screen blankly. I unexpectically still love this movie. It's quite worrying at times but I suggest you watch this seeing as you'll never watch anything else like it!

The second part, Die Buster the Movie, mixes large chunks of the second OVA series with a few altered or newly-animated scenes to create a truncated take on Nono's story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","Recommendation: Watch the original series instead.  This is basically a long summary with nothing new whatsoever, so only come here if you're looking for a quicker rewatch.  
 
Starting out, I wondered if I could get away with simply watching these movies instead of the series considering that they both reflected the same story. I knew the series would have more material, but maybe these newer movies might have updated visuals, or might tell the story better or at least more succinctly?  Unfortunately, no: I'm pretty sure the movies have no new scenes, the visuals are the same, and the plot moves past succinct here.   
 
Both series are condensed enough, but these movies condense past the point of comfort. With all the cutting they had to do, scenes jump around a bit more than they should. The brunt of the action's there, but the development to that action, and especially the reasoning for that action suffers in the movies. 
  
But please do try the original series!  They already have excellent reviews on MAL, so I won't unnecessarily delve into them here.  But I'll just say this: if you don't like Gunbuster (Top wo Nerae), please still give the significantly more modern sequel a chance (but do know that although the stories and characters of the two OVAs are mostly separate, you'll enjoy Diebuster (Top wo Nerae 2) more having first finished its predecessor.  It's a spoiler to say why).  Dazzling protagonists that evolve well throughout each episode... rare beasts indeed, but we find one in both.  Come back for these compilation movies only if you get the urge to rewatch both of these underground gems.

I could see a lot of people dropping the anime after about 10 episodes, but the story offers something very new and refreshing which is odd given the year it was made. I honestly saw myself dropping the series maybe midway through, but you have to stay into it! The art is okay, the anime was made at the turn of the millenium give it a break. People that are very particullar about artwork might want to stay away from this anime. Moving on to the sound, the opening/closing themes are both repetitive and aren't anything to write home about. I couldn't tell you the difference between sounds of arms and regular guns, and the voice acting is pretty close to horrible. Still yet, I can't give it lower than a 6 because of the sound effects. The sound effects made my day! The characters aren't anything special. They serve their purposes and don't really develop until later on in the story. But as the story and fillers progress, you start to find affection, humor, and curiosity for all of the characters.  
 
Basically, here is what it comes down to. 
-You HAVE to wait for the story to develop, slow down and enjoy it.  
-This is an anime for people willing to look past the art, and more into the meaning and depth of the story.  
-Skip the ending song. 
 
In conclusion, I find the anime to be amazing in terms of story, but the amount of fillers really made the score suffer for me. You should be able to find it for cheap anywhere, and I truly recommend picking it up if you can. Give it a chance! Thanks for reading!

As much as I'd like to give it a passable score for being just a 30 second video, they could have at least made the effort of having a visible plot that didn't have to be good. 
 
The animation is surprisingly good for such a short skit.

I'd say the sound is above average at best. I don't see the point of the child being the narrator, although I must admit the music is very catching, especially the beginning.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Well the thing about this review is it's directly compared to the other series, favorably or unfavorably. And after just writing a Lucky Star review, I thought it was only right that I write a Lucky Star OVA review. In fact, I only got up the energy to write a Lucky Star review to the community. 
 
So, now that I've filled out the preface, it's time to get to the individual qualities of the short movie. Or actually, just medium as an OVA. 
 
1. Story 
Well how does one comment on one story, that's slice of life episodic comedy? 
Well, you rate it on being an episodic, slice of life comedy. 
This one doesn't quite pace as the other one did. And has quite a bit of cool down and then short spurts of comedy. It's not so chatty and eventful as the main series. 
 
In this way it does make it feel a bit more like a movie. But at the same time, it doesn't do what it does quite well as it did with the main series. You expect more out of it than you get. It moves slow and uneventful, and ends before you know it. 
Well at least in it's favor, it ends long before you want it to end. 
 
2. Art 
It's the same great artwork as before. And there's no change at all. 
So there's really nothing to say about this. It's the iconic moe art style we know and love Lucky Star for. 
 
Ten out of ten. 
 
3. Sound 
Well you know...I didn't even notice the sound too much this time around. It doesn't have that memorable opening song that I remember. And it all seemed sort of quiet. Too quiet at times. It didn't really have to have all the music though. 
 
And the character voices were as cute as ever. 
 
4. Character 
I think I have to commend them for spending the time they did on characters like Patricia Martin. But overall, it felt like when it was supposed to be a party, that it was an empty party. I think this part...this...OVA..was lacking in some of the character charm and development that Lucky Star often had. In the case with everything with this OVA, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good. 
 
5. Enjoyment 
Even if an OVA isn't as good, it's a Lucky Star OVA. Meaning we'll love it. 
Seriously, how long were we starved for this? Too long. I went through every second of this thinking how I couldn't believe I was getting to watch more Lucky Star and fearful of every minute I drew closer to the end. It might have not been jam packed with the same about of fun as the main series, but it was still a lot of fun and well worth the watch. 
 
6. Overall 
Overall, it was what the number 8 says. It was very good. And well worth the watch and very much needed, beyond needed. It was almost cruel how long we had to wait. But it wasn't every thing Lucky Star was. I think a person is better off watching Lucky Star the series first, and then watching this because they're still absolutely starved like I was for more. It may not be one hundred percent as good as the original, but it's still got the magic. I don't want anyone to think and to get the impression that because it doesn't shine just as hard as Lucky Star the TV series that it's not every bit a good and enjoyable anime. It's a quality watch and I recommend it to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful This will probably be the shortest review I will ever write. 
 
As I said in my review for the Lucky Star series, KyoAni constantly references and criticizes the anime genre as a whole. Significantly, it also references and criticizes consumers of anime, including those watching the series. This OVA goes exactly one step further, exploring what would happen if the viewers’ volition filters back into the anime. What would happen if the fandom – and its associated theories, frustrations, and obsessions – become part of the show itself? Well, you get this OVA, which in Lucky Star fashion follows the same plotless, trope-filled, single-sided characterization that the main series is known for. 
 
For better or worse, you absolutely do need to have seen the main series before seeing this, as this OVA interacts differently with those who are familiar with its characters and style. Watched the series? Yes, you need to watch this too. 


          
 
       Helpful Ahh the Lucky Star OVA. While it didn't fully capture the spirit of the anime series, it's still great that we are fortunate to even see the clan again after the anime was finish, so I can't really complain too much. The only saving grace *for me at lease*  was that Konata was funnier and otaku as ever and I liked Tsukasa more in the movie then in the anime series because she was ""cuter"" I didn't like that the Lucky Channal was live action it was not funny almost unwatchable and it was much shorter then I expected to be only around 43 minutes long

This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all. 
 
 Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it. 
 
Bakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!. 
 
Bakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way. 
 
In terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman. 
 
The animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great ""in-universe manga details"" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected. 
 
Without a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a ""near masterpiece"" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these ""characters"" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime? 
 
LA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!

          
 
       Helpful I have just dropped after completing episode 6. I enjoyed season 1, although not spectacular, it was a story with meaning. it was about two friends with a shared goal struggling for their dreams. The downside was the love interest, lets get together after we succeed. In my mind a relationship is tested with the lows more then the highs, struggle together surely. But i believed this was more to do with culture, my own being wildly different to the protagonists. 
 
Season 2 started up OK, i didn't understand why they would change the editor. The new assistants while not good were not bad either, flavorless is what comes to mind. Where i object is the hospitalization and this absolute obsession with work and the handling of it. Hes collapsed while in hospital, clearly in pain and his love interest objects to a nurse being called and hands him his markers. His uncle died of overwork, surely he should know better then anyone that health matters. Maybe if i were 10 years younger i could overlook this, but as an adult it doesn't sit right with me.

          
 
       Helpful Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second. 
 
The first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story. 
The second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12 episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside. 
 
Art I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end. 
 
Sound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about. 
 
Character, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = = 
 
Enjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again. 
 
Overall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is. 
 
Those who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too. 
 
Those who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed. 
 
Those who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.

19,5118,19,7.643272061,Anime with an ensemble casts,Suzumiya Haruhi-chan no Yuuutsu,"A parody series featuring the entire cast of  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya  in a smaller form factor.  Among the changes are: Yuki plays eroge, Haruhi is even more obnoxiuous and loud, Mikuru is even more emotional and Koizumi harbors a deep love for Kyon.  Kyon, on the other hand, is generally the same as ever.","['Comedy', 'Parody']","Critic’s Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2014. Review #79: The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya. 
 
Let’s Go! 
 
This is about A comical spin-off of the popular ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" anime series that originally aired back in 2006 involving all the major characters in more child-like forms of their animated selves going through various spoofs of previous plot line; like Nagato and the dreaded laptop with a twist. face offs with the rack of costumes that were stuffed in the corner of the club room. and dodge ball tournaments on a sugar rush. 
 
Yeah, it’s a random spin-off. and this spin-off is awesome. Well, for the most part. During the first 4 episodes, there was some CGI animation, but afterwards… Kyoto Animation went back to the 2D Animation while staying true to the chibi designs that distinguishes the Main series of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi-chan is a Kyoto Animation production. It is indeed a spinoff of the series and this is not a TV anime, it is a web series. As far as web series go, the animation is quite good and for it being made in the same year as another web anime known as Hetalia. Haruhi-chan does look impressive for being an Original Net Anime, assuming ONA’s have lower budgets than TV Anime and OVA’s. Despite the first 4 episodes being CGI-animated, it looks great. 
 
The music compliments the spin-off and I don’t have much to say about it since it’s not heavily important in this spin-off 
 
Like the series, The Japanese cast and English Dub cast do not disappoint and both casts do step it up by making the comedy work. I already said enough about both casts when I reviewed the series. 
 
When it comes to characters, everyone is in chibi form and this helps to differentiate from the main series. Since this is a spin-off, I can tell you that you may want to give character development a pass since this is a spinoff that puts heavy emphasis on humor and laughs. Everyone is over the top and even Yuki Nagato is funny in this one. If you liked the characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. Chances are, you’ll like this spin-off just as much. 
 
If you got an hour and a half, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya does not disappoint as a spinoff. It’s just as fun as the main series but it is more funnier than the main series. Like the series, this is a great one to watch with classmates if you are in high school or college. 
 
The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya was available by Bandai Entertainment and it was released alongside Nyoron Churuya-san, but unfortunately it is out of print. 
 
With all that said, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya is a fun spinoff to the popular Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. The animation is good for an ONA, character development and plot get a pass, but it is a fun series because of how funny it is. It is an awesome spinoff. 
 
I give The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya an 8.9 out of 10. it is VERY GOOD! 
 
Feel free to leave a comment and join the club.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, seeing as how TMoHS is my absolute favorite anime of all time, this review will be extremely biased and may not be helpful at all. That being said here is my review: 
TMoHCS is basically a completely non-cannon and chibi version of TMoHS that is basically a little short-series consisting of about 3-5 minute episodes of hilarity. 
TMoHCS was heavily enjoyable for big fans of the series but would probably be mediocre with a couple of big laughs here and there for people who didn't like TMoHS or aren't fans of the series. This is pretty much just for when you're bored and would like to watch something slightly different. 
I enjoyed this heavily because I love the characters from TMoHS and this is really just a filler while I waited for the third season of TMoHS to come out. 
Hope I helped and I hope you enjoy the show!

          
 
       Helpful Okay, the only reason that I'm still a Haruhi fan is for two reasons: 1) the original Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2006 and 2) this ONA. ^^ 
 
The original idea of The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya came from a parody comic series that pretty much subtly made fun of the original anime. And, I'm not usually one for these kinds of parodies, but I just couldn't resist~! ^^ Also, I love how evil Yuki is shown to be in the series... *devious grin* Not to mention that random lion that was thrown into the mix as well... ^^;;;; 
 
The art... Well, let's just say that it's very rare to see chibis still keep their proper anatomy and such in tact. This, is a good thing. Haruhi-chan Suzumiya has managed to pull this off quite well. But, then again, we are talking about Kyoto Animation. Also, the first couple of episodes were done with 3D generated cell-shaded characters. After the first four or five episodes (give or take), though, they resumed to 2D traditional cell-shaded characters. 
 
The sound was, unbelievably, astounding. Usually, I'd get annoyed with Mikuru's voice, but the situations that the story showed made it so that it was actually quite enjoyable~! 
 
Characters seemed to be put on a more comedic spin. But, you do have to realize that this is a parody series that focuses on some points on the original series and pretty much spends about 2-5 minutes making fun of it. But, because they focused so much on the comedic side of things, there wasn't any real development in character. But, that's a given when you're watching a series of parodizing shorts on one of the Anime Industry's largest franchises. 
 
The enjoyment was DEFINATELY 10/10~! Not only did it have the element of satiric comedy, but it also had some... risque-ness into it as well. (is that even a word??) Such as the ""wall between hearts."" (Or, something like that.) Also, there was some awesome ass-kicking in a few episodes. ^^ 
 
Overall, it's not a story and plot-driven anime. It's not exactly focused on character development, either. No, it's merely a satire that makes fun of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, and personally, I think that they've done a swell job~! 
 
I give ""The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya"" a grand total score of 9/10!

The intertwining lives of many unhappy souls are drawn together by the birth of the young prince Siddhartha, who embarks on a spiritual journey, becomes Buddha, ""the Enlightened One,"" and attempts to bring about a spiritual rebirth of the people in this desperate age.

It was only later that he became the Buddha, also know as the enlighted one "" 
 
Movie missed point.  Well this movie was something on a different level, it was breath taking and unique.  
 
Story: Well at first glance i expected it to be movie only about Buddha and not only his past, which was quite dissapointing. They basically only showed his past and event in that era when there was a lot of slaves trafficking, people living in poverty that had to steal to survive. Also story was very confusing from the beggining to the end and it was more focused on other characters than Buddha itself, or should we call him "" prince "" cause that fits more in this movie, cause they only showed a small glance at the ending about him becoming Buddha and going to search for the answer.Also it was very sad story, and characters struggling through poverty and prince enjoying his life, and he never saw life behind the wealthy life  until somewhere aroung middle of the movie, where he meet Migaila ( minor character ), girl that grow up in poverty.She had a lot of inpact on his view on the world and other poor peoples. 
 
Anyway it was very confusing but interesting story that was also depressive and sad for me, but kinda dissapointing ( and when i said kinda i mean just a little bit ) 
 
Animation: Now this was very good, it was way much better than i expected it to be. You could see how they put effort in every single detail but some scenes were a little bit rushed. 
 
Sound: Well it was good. And also outro song is really nice. 
 
Characters: This is where i felt kinda dissapointed. 
 
Siddharta Gauitama aka "" Budhha "" is good guy from royal family that doesn't really fighting and seeing other people suffer. Pretty much you can describe him as good guy from rich family that isn't looking down on other poor people or people with weak social status.He doesn't care about other peoples opinion that he shouldn't talk to poor and weak people. Also his voice acting was kinda bad if you ask me, i mean you could get guy from the street and he would do it better. 
 
Chapra aka "" Best swordman in kingdom "", "" General "" is the character that was getting attention most of the time.You can describe him as goodbay guy ( really don't know how to describe it, it's unique ) which grow up in a poverty and saw a lot of people dead. There wasn't really much of his feels in this movie except him showing his  love for his mother and reversed. 
 
Tatta  aka "" Guy with mystical power "" he is the character that i didn't really get much, he was basically once time with Chapra, and then Chapra went to become general and that's when all his trails are losing. But he isn't fully without feelings, he showed anger , chillness and i don't really know what much to say about him.. sorry :P 
 
Overall: As i statead in beggining, this movie was capable of so much and confusing story and voice acting kinda bringed it down a little bit. Anyway it's enjoyable and decent movie that can be watched.They will probably show more in sequel to this movie ( Buezuka Osamu no Buddha: Owarinaki Tabi )

— Al-Mutanabbi 
 
This story talks about two boys who were born in different conditions. Chapra, is an ambitious slave. While Siddhartha is an aristocrat. 
 
The movies starts with introducing the main characters; giving the viewer an idea of ​​the characters relations to each other, and also tells us about the current setting; which is a cruel world with a never-ending war between two nations; Shudra and Kosala. Also the movie acquaint us with the four-social class system people live with; where the worst of the four were the laborers and the slaves. 
 
Since the other characters only support the story; i'm only going to review these two main characters  who serve as core of this story. 
 
The story begins with Chapra; a slave boy who couldn't bear the cruel life of being a slave. it will start with showing us how Chapra befriended with Tatta. Chapra's journey starts after he made a selfish request from  his friend Tatta to help him in becoming a Kshatriya warrior; to make a better life for himself. And in order to achieve his goal, he goes through a mutually beneficial relationship with one of the well-known Kosalan generals. 
 
The other boy Siddhartha, was born in a royal family. He was a child growing bored of the privileged life of a prince, and forced to learn military tactics and swordsmanship by his father; in order to become his successor. But unlike his father; he despises war, hates violence, and uninterested in glory; which resulted in making him inspired to seek the answers of the purpose of life, to seek a way to end the meaningless wars. 
 
The movie was a bit too rushed at the beginning which was weak, making some of the character's decisions feels like...robotic, non-alive. 
 
The Art/Animation was good overrall. However, I was expecting better animations for a movie. 
 
Sound:  Music wasn't prominent, but wasn't unfitting either. Voice acting was good overral except for young Siddhartha's voice which was like somebody was just reading from a paper without feelings. 
 
Overrall: likeable themes such as the historical setting and good depiction of social issues even though it didn't focus on them that much. The movie was very well done overrall. 


          
 
       Helpful To me, this movie completely misses its (presumed) point. 
 
SYNOPSIS: The creators try to get the viewer feeling nearly as bad about all the suffering in the world as Siddharta/Buddha does, they failed for 2 reasons: 
- rushed simplification 
- the use of a lot of violence to ENTERTAIN the viewers, which (out of complete paradox) contradicts the primary purpose 
 
Being about the life and struggles of Buddha I just expected something completely different.  
 
Before watching it I didn't know that the producers planned it to be the start of a series of films, I also do not know the manga. My expectations were nurtured by two books: 
'Siddhartha' by Hermann Hesse 
+ 
'Old Path - White Clouds' by Thích Nhất Hạnh 
Even with keeping these good books and my perception of Buddha out of mind this first movie is rather weak, misconceived and filled with... yeah, fillers that add nothing to the story of Buddha. 
 
It doesn't go into philosophical depths, which it could at least try (while being about Buddha), but maybe I can free the makers of some of their debts here because most of the philosophising sure is supossed to happen in later phases of Siddharta's life. 
 
By the end of the movie he makes a really strong and hard decision. But the way he asks himself questions about the world and its cruelty doesn't get me convinced about his decision at all (unlike the non-movie Siddharta - which is, by the way, annoyingly called SHIddharta throughout the movie) 
His unsettlement seems rushed and WAAAAY too simplified to me. 
 
Also, I feel like the movie character Siddhartha directs his questions/views just too much on the material world (war/sickness/dying) and too less on the suffering of mind+soul. 
With all the violence in this movie the producers couldn't have aimed for an 'all-family' audience and therefore its depth, its philosophising could and SHOULD be more profound. 
 
As I said above the side-stories don't add depth or entertainment to the story. One can clearly see why the creators included them into the movie: to give us a clue about the sorrows Siddharta is feeling, but because of their simplification and stereotypy that just didn't work out at all. 
 
The art and music is pretty solid. What you'd expect from a Tezuka adaption: strong, sometimes even a little too loud colours, not even ONE more pencil or brush stroke than necessary to depict a character and solid animation (only with lots of animals and warriors in the picture the animation was somewhat jerking). 
 
All in all...... a HUGE bummer! (that didn't get me interested in a continuation) 
5/10

I honestly can't remember the Wonderland episodes much besides one awkward scene and Grell being the Cheshire Cat. I know I wasn't too entertained by them though. ""Welcome to the Phantomhive's"" puts the viewer in the show, like the characters are talking directly to you, which, to me, felt kind of odd and cringy when not actually playing a video game. The ""Making Of"" episode is in a documentary style, interviewing the characters as if they're just actors playing the roles of the story. I didn't care for it, but it might be amusing for you, if you like that sort of thing. The episode about the reapers (""The Tale of William"") was probably the best for me.

Story & Art ( An Acceptable 8) 
 
As expected, the artwork hasen't changed much just like the series and such. So all is still well. The story is good and all but not on every episode. It probably deserves a 7 instead.... but what brought it to an 8 was how the humor and more scenes with the supporting characters replaced it and brought up the score. 
 
Sound & Character (Nice 9) 
 
The Opening (that is brought in 1 or 2 episodes I think) are the same as the second season. Not every episode has an opening though. The ending isn't all that much looking forward to, but it plays pleasant music by Kalafina. The voice of Alois Trancy's Thompson Brothers (Or whatever those triplet butlers are called :\) is kind of annoying but decent. I've never heard them talk before. The music is great. The characters still remain the same of course. And with more Grell xD. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall ( Just A 7) 
 
It was all good, I think they could've done better on the stories in the episodes, (9), I think one of the episodes was just done from running out of ideas, (8), and they should've they should've made a little clip for ending in the last episode since it seemed kinda empty without one. (7). None-the-less, I'd recommend watching it of course. Not everyone's opinion is the same :). 
 
     


          
 
       Helpful This specials were so funny. Especially the making of. So good. Even better then the second series itself. All of them made me laugh except the story of will the shinigami, and the clade/alois one. But that´s only because I don´t like Claude and Alois.

19,4189,22,6.889478032,Anime with an ensemble casts,Fuyu no Sonata,"Based on the Korean Drama of the same name, Yoo Jin falls in love with Joon Sang as a young girl. After losing him in an accident, she decides to marry her childhood friend. However, Yoo Jin meets someone looking exactly like her lost love, putting her in a bind.  The program featured 23 members of the original Korean cast voicing the characters and was broadcast with Japanese subtitles.","['Drama', 'Romance']","There is a sweet, succinct Korean word that sums up the core of this series: makjang. For the uninitiated, makjang is an element that infers the use of unbelievable, often extreme plot elements that are not limited to: incest, rape, adultery, and terminal illness. Korean dramas often utilize this to keep viewers in suspense, interested in the outcome of the storyline—and Winter Sonata is no stranger to venturing in this territory. If anything, it swathes itself in layers of these extremes, and yet despite sounding ridiculously unbelievable as a result, there is something addicting about the series. 
 
The plot plays out like a melodrama; star-crossed lovers who want nothing more than to be wrapped in the embrace of one another while the whole world is seemingly against them. If that seems too reductive it's because it's quite honestly that simple. While there is nothing inherently impressive about the setup, the payoff is obvious because Winter Sonata was not an international hit without good reason. 
 
This series knows how to lure you in with subtle appeal in the beginning, and while the setup isn't novel, it's refreshing in that it wastes no time in pairing our couple together from the outset. Winter Sonata is nothing if not efficient with its pacing, although it does begin to drag a bit near the end with supplemental material that seems to verge on being shoved in to drag on the episode count. Regardless, if you're concerned over whether or not the plot will catch you, if the synopsis has genuine appeal to you and you don't mind the makjang elements, then this series will catch you from the moment you start and you will be hooked. If you have difficulty buying into or enjoying some of the tropes that were mentioned above, then Winter Sonata will feel far too heavy, unbelievable, and clunky for you to enjoy. 
 
A defining feature of the main quartet of the series is that they are all obsessed with something, and as a result they are riddled with flaws. That on the one hand means they carry some measure of depth but they are just as equally frustrating for it. Yu Jin pines after her only love to the exception of all else; it's as though it is humanly impossible for her to consider the consequences and repercussions of her single-minded obsession with one man. She would sacrifice anything and everything—her childhood friend, the mother that adores her—if that means she gets to be with the one person she wants to be with. Yu Jin is just one example, however, and when I say obsession I mean these individuals verge into the very extremes of the word. 
 
One unique aspect of the series is the animation, which is decidedly different from many of its likeness (read: shoujo). It's a more realistic style that matches perfectly with the essence of the series. It's not flawless, but it has an undeniable quaint charm to it. For those unaccustomed to variant styles of animation and more adapted to the mainstream, it may be an adjustment with Winter Sonata—but once you sit through a few episodes, you quickly grow to appreciate how unique the art is. 
 
Sound is perhaps one of the biggest redeeming qualities of the series, as its opening is absolutely enchanting and perfectly describes the emotions of our main couple as they struggle to reconcile the past and the present. It is an added bonus that Winter Sonata stands out as especially unique because it's one of the very few Korean dubbed animations. The soundtrack helps set the mood, and the voice acting is done by the original cast of the drama. While that might not mean much to original viewers, its still an incredible enjoyment to watch on account of how talented the actors are at infusing emotion in each scene. 
 
Although I am a huge Korean drama enthusiast, and therefore accustomed to the manner of cliches and tropes—many of which are utilized in Winter Sonata, I have never viewed the original series. That said, I think the animated series pays a great tribute to the original. It is very entertaining with a suspenseful edge that has you waiting on pins and needles at the end of each episode as we are thrown yet another wrench in the fate between Yu Jin and Joon Sang. As much as I can laud the series with praise for being as enjoyable as it is, however, it is greatly riddled with flaws and not without cumbersome material that does tend to drag with a longer episode count. The quick, snappy pacing is a wonderful bonus as the material of the original had to be somewhat compressed—but that also means the emotional, poignant scenes tend to rush by too quickly and leave us unsatiated rather than appreciative of the true weight of the tragedy occuring on screen. 
 
The characters themselves are almost poetic in their anguish at least until we realize how ridiculously selfish they are being in their individual obsessions with little regard for any of the people around them. How the plot essentially boils down, at the end, to one person's obstinate mistake—and that is perhaps the most frustrating realization in the finale. It does little to reassure that the episodes of suspense were well-deserved. 
 
Having said all of this, Winter Sonata is indeed a unique series that warrants some measure of positive acclaim and praise for what it does accomplish. However, it is not a flawless series deserving of quite as much hype as it seems to have garnered with a small base of users. Perhaps it is something that has flown under too many people's radars—because as a love story, it is sickeningly addictive in the worst way possible and enjoyable as a result of that. In a way, it's almost like a cautionary tale because it displays the worst traits of human nature—a willingness to sacrifice everything in a single-minded, self-centered attempt to achieve self-satisfaction.

          
 
       Helpful I read some reviews of this show from other websites and though that maybe some poisnts need to be put down for viewers to choose or not to choose to see this anime. 
 
The anime is a remake of a Korean Drama of the same name. So comparsion of this anime with the original show is inevitable maybe for people who have seen the drama. (I havent). The story chronicles the hardships the main protagonists go through due to past mistakes of their elders.  
 
Story[10/10]: Very innovative story. Plus its a full romance series of unconditional love between the main male and female protagonist. And quiet an assertive one in expressing the exact rosy lines every romance series lover wishes to hear at some point of time while watching, in my opinion. I loved the series exactly for this point. Its not a typical high school romance or the normal slice of life genre show. It is a romance between two grown ups (25+ age) so many of the fans of teenager/highschool romance might not feel it very welcoming. But still I insist to watch this really nice story. There's a love traingle invovled but these relationships have been shown extremely well and every bit believable.  
 
Art[10/10]: The art again though not of the typical shoujo anime as simple yet beautiful. And I think the charm of each character actually is brought out nicely in the art. background scenes, though landscapes are not too many in the show are nicely done. 
 
Sound[10/10]: The language is Korean for the anime which is difficult to adjust to in listening at the beginning but you'll get a hang of it eventually. I only felt that maybe a younger sounding voice for the main male and female protagonists could have suited better. I mean they are grown up but not like 40-50. But the strongest point in the sound section definitely has to be the beautiful Piano peices and the OP, ED and insert songs. All again romance theme based which help out a lot in building the atmosphere even more in the episodes. Especially the OP is very catchy. 
 
Character[10/10]: Wonderfully developed again. Very strong and believable. Even the supporting cast has a good impact on the flow of the story for most of the time. 
 
Enjoyment[10/10]: I personally thoroughly enjoyed the show with some sudden twists in the plot executed aptly. Plus it was the first time I have seen an anime where the main characters are assertive about their feelings for each other. It really moves you to tears sometimes. 
 
Overall[10/10]: 1) Very innovative story 
2) Full romance series 
3) May not be liked by a younger audience below 20 since the story itself contains characters who are a bit older. 
4) Very soothing Piano pieces 
5) Well developed plot and good continuity of the story. 
 
Just loved this experience :)

          
 
       Helpful Winter Sonata revolves around a love triangle between Yujin, Sanghyuk and Joonsang. There are many one sided loves involved and the heartbreaking moments are constant. There was barely any down time for me to recover from all the sad happenings. 
 
Throughout the series, the love triangle creates the domino effect: hurting one after or another.  
 
The art is nothing to be amazed at, but it's nice enough to enjoy. The animations were a little rough, but overall, it's appealing to the eye. 
 
My favorite character would have to be Sanghyuk. In my mind, he suffered the most throughout the whole plot. *Light spoilers* He leads a one sided love with Yujin, trying to replace the shoes of her first love for 10 years...from Yujin's perspective, she dragged Sanghyuk through the mud knowing deep down she never once loved Sanghyuk while he's pouring out everything for her. She lied to him, accepting his marriage proposal. Even after all the confessions from Yujin, he always stood by her. For me at least, he was the bigger man and did all he could for her. Overall, his character hit me the hardest and despite the ending, I still feel he's suffering inside.  
 
So! Watch this if you want a romance story that will keep you on your edge, urging you to find out what's going to happen next!

19,800,23,6.778067055,Anime with an ensemble casts,NieA Under 7,"In the 21st century, aliens have arrived on Earth and live among humans. In sleepy Enohana, the dirt-poor student Chigasaki Mayuko finds herself living together with NieA, a low-caste (""Under Seven"") alien. While Mayuko struggles diligently to make ends meet, NieA seems to be totally unconcerned with the consequences of her actions. As the odd couple throws off the expected sparks, the wrecked alien mothership looms in the background...  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","A title born from the people responsible for the creation of Serial Experiments Lain. NieA_7 was based of a doujinshi of the same name by the esteemed Yoshitoshi ABe. Apparently, the staff of Lain wanted to create a very light-hearted title to follow up the sever tone found in Lain. In short: this doesn’t really work out in the show’s favor. Why? I’m getting there.The story revolves around a hard-working high-schooler Mayuko (Mayu), who lives on her own and struggles to make ends meet between her three low-wage jobs. Mayu is a shy, introverted, and to make life worse, has an obnoxious, food-swiping, UFO obsessed alien named Niea for a room-mate (ranked as an “under 7 alien as per her alien class system for some reason). Did I forget to mention? Aliens have colonized on Earth years prior and now live alongside humans. I’d have gone on longer with the synopsis, but the fact that I did not points to my first issue regarding the show, the lack of explanation regarding just about everything regarding the setting. Not that I’m implying that leaving a number of questions open for the viewer is bad thing mind you. A later work based off of another ABe title, Haibane Renmei, did “leaving stuff to your imagination” in a way that NieA_7 is far, far off from. In Haibane Renmei, questions are left behind, but not a way that affects the narrative or renders elements of the plot pointless, as is the case with NieA_7 unfortunately. Gaps in information have everything to do with the “alien” aspect of the show. For the most part, this a show that mostly does not really care much for it’s sci-fiesque setting and keeps a more grounded focus on mostly the human characters and their daily interactions.  It’s unfortunate in this case since the show lightly touches upon themes of alienation, discrimination, and the idea of adjusting to new settings that could’ve gone much further then what ended up happening. What we got instead was far less compelling (more on that a bit later since now I’m harping on what the show didn’t do as opposed to what it did). The opening episode leaves behind a number of questions and they only accumulate as the show progresses. Like, why did the aliens come to earth? What’s up with the mother ship? Why does it send out signals to Niea? How can Niea hear the signals even though she’s the only antennae-less alien in the entire series? I could go further, but the point is clear. Have any questions regarding the setting? Well, they’ll likely remain just that, only questions. The show’s tiny focus essentially renders most of the setting as pointless add-ons. I’m still not really sure what the point of the aliens were in this show at all. Even though we hardly learn a thing about their species, they still appear regularly to perform their comedic shtick which I felt to be hit or miss. The aliens also ultimately add nothing to the show and have no involvement in the show’s central conflict: Mayu’s inner conflict (asides from Niea, whose mostly only adds to Mayu’s stress) . The sub-plot regarding Niea and the alien mother ship was not given nearly enough detail since it mostly happens off-screen and no one cares enough to ask about it by the time the show’s over. Easily the biggest head-scratcher of the entire series.  
 
Yeah, so this is a series that tosses some potentially cool elements at the viewers only to say ""screw it, let's do some comedy"". Disappointing maybe, but that's not really what sinks the show. This would not be as big a problem for me if the comedy was actually good, but that's not the case. Mostly the result of one big nasty wrench that was thrown into my enjoyment of the show the titular character: Niea. She's basically Edward from Cowboy Bebop, except she puts all her time and effort into being downright annoying. She consistently torments Mayuko by gathering trash in her apartment, blowing up parts of her property, and worst of all constantly whining about food, or being hungry. Oh god, every time food ends up being the subject you can expect the exact same thing: Niea: FOOOOOD! GIMME MORE FOOOOD Mayuko: NO, THIS IS ALL WE HAVE Niea: FOOOOOOOOD! So much effort was put into making Niea is wacky and annoying as possible that the creators forgot to make her likable. The humor is passable when Niea is not  around (kinda liked Chiaki and Karna, and the Weed Bath house episode is pretty darn funny), but that's nowhere near being enough to make up for when she is. The audio doesn't really much to praise either, asides from the voice acting (watched it mostly dubbed, the voice actors did a good job of trying to sell the humor, but they were fighting an uphill battle to begin with).  
 
The soundtrack, I'm not even sure if there was one, If there is, it's either too muted or extremely unnoticeable since I can't recall taking notice of background music outside of the last episode. The ending theme, however, I found to be catchy and I dug the stringy instrumentals. The opening? Ghastly. Sounds like some dude who walked into a recording studio and tried to sing with strep throat. Lastly, I can't remember having ever given much attention to a show's sound effects, but  NieA_7 is an exception. The creators of the show literally ripped several cheesy sound-bites from the Hannah Barbara library and tossed them into the show to enhance the already weak comedy. The sound effects are often times the closest the show is to being funny sadly enough.  
 
This show does at least have more to it then missed opportunities and mostly sucky comedy. Mayuko herself is an interesting character when Niea is not involved. Her struggles come off as very as very easy to relate to. She starts off as a the ""straight man"" of sorts in an annoying comedic duo, but the later episodes shed light on her surrounding circumstances that are common and cause most people stress in some way or another. Whether it be her monetary troubles, social anxiety, living away from home. I have to give the show some props for appropriately portraying these issues, even in-spite of all the baggage. Don't expect any catharsis though. The show doesn't really end so much as just ""stops"" without much spectacle or payoff.  
 
The strengths of NieA_7 underscore (lol) just what this series should have been all along: A tale of a young, hard working introvert trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. Instead, we have a title that bogs itself down with unnecessary elements before coming to a somewhat unsatisfying stop. If slice 'o' life comedy is your anathema, you'd best look elsewhere since there's nothing here that will change your mind. For everyone else, your probably better of watching stuff like Planetes, a SOL/Drama that succeeds on all both fronts, or Haibane Renmei for mysterious elements that are thought provoking, rather than rage inducing.  
 
PS: You probably shouldn't watch this show if you are Indian and easily offended

          
 
       Helpful NieA Under 7 is Yoshitoshi Abe's (other) slice of life series which I felt pretty lukewarm about and didn't fully appreciate when I first watched it.  
After revisiting it however, my view of it has changed dramatically.  
 
Not only do I think it's a great slice of life series that slowly makes you feel absorbed in its world, but I also think it's a great character study that thoroughly explores its main character's fear of growing up, social anxiety, lack of an objective in life and her daily struggles as a cram student who barely scrapes by financially.  
 
So the series is set in a contemporary Japan where aliens landed with a huge mother-ship and its inhabitants started spreading across the country. But instead of being a hostile invasion they just end up integrating in to society and living as any other human and nobody seems to mind nor does this bring any significant change to Japan. 
These aliens are a thinly veiled allegory to Indians (real Indians, not native Americans) since they have a class system very similar to the one used in India. There's even one alien character that has an Indian skin tone and accent. Their appearance is basically the same as humans except they have elf ears and antennas on their heads. 
 
The main character Mayuko, is a cram student working a part time job who's kind of a loner and socially awkward. She lives in an apartment complex that is also a bathhouse run by a middle aged woman named Kotomi. She also has an alien roommate called Niea who's a deadbeat and a freeloader, constantly making Mayuko's life harder than it already is. 
 
Mayuko's relationship with Niea is the heart and soul of this series. Both Mayuko and Niea are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their class in their respective societies. Niea is an ""Under 7"" which is the lowest class among the aliens and Mayuko is incredibly poor and living hand to mouth. So they basically find comfort in each other.  
 
At its core this series is all about how Mayuko can't stand having Niea around but also realizing that her life is much worse without her since she's the only one she feels comfortable being herself with. We know this because when Mayuko interacts with other characters she's a lot more polite, shy and reserved. This is especially obvious when it comes to her friend from cram school who she likes but doesn't quite feel at home with, even looking for excuses to not go out with her and her friends. Or the landlord Kotomi who'm she looks up to as kind of a mother figure and a role model since she's a hard worker who works two jobs and generally seems to have a hard life while being seemingly unphased by it. 
She's also no different with her work colleagues at a restaurant, which is this middle aged man who's dependent on his cute 8 year old daughter (who's relationship clearly mirrors that of the main duo). 
It's also worth mentioning that Niea is envied by both Mayuko and the landlord since she is free of responsibilities and holds nothing back in every way they can't. 
 
I also want to bring up some of the series' symbolism like Mayuko's watch she got from her father symbolizing her fear of losing her childhood or the apartment complex she's living in (being a place she vacationed in with her dad as a child), being a clear parallel to the alien mother-ship since the things that happen to both coincide with one another. clearly communicating that we should all say goodbye to our childhoods at some point. There's lot's of little details like that which just flew over my head in my first viewing.  This is not much of a sci fi series, the sci fi ideas here are only important for how they are relevant to its characters. It's mostly indirect, but we do also get bits and pieces of information about the alien society and how they function within our own spread throughout the series. 
But I don't wanna get too deep in to that. Since I want this to be a review, I'll just speak in a broader way from here on out. 
 
Narratively, the series starts out fairly episodic comprised of little funny adventures in each episode until it gains more momentum and has more continuity in the second half until it ends with quite a satisfying conclusion. A passage of time is shown to us through the changing of seasons but there's no way to know exactly how much time is passing. Also there's not a single wasted episode, every single one gives you more information about the characters whether it be through dialogue or having their actions speak for themselves. What makes these characters feel so well defined is that each of them seems to have at least 2 distinct relationships with two other characters in which they seem to behave differently with each. And the main character specifically ends up being a very deep and identifiable one mainly through her actions and interactions with other characters as well as hints we get throughout the series about her past. 
 
The series' tone might be hard to digest at first (an issue I had in my first viewing) since it ranges from wacky comedy hijinks to relaxing and meditative to even becoming quite depressing and somber depending on the characters' mood. Most of the wacky comedy comes from Niea who's loud, hyperactive and generally just a useless pest. One thing I'd say in defense of this, is that the show is much heavier on comedy in its first half where it switches from a relaxing tone to a wacky comedic one, but it rarely interrupts the depressing atmosphere that it gains in the second half since it really highlights what's truly important in this series.    
 
Comedy might be subjective but I do think it is well handled here, both in terms of delivery and timing. Very often jokes seem to be set up way ahead of time (and often are an important part of the story) have a clear pay off point and don't overstay their welcome. Even to the point where the director cuts away seconds before is acceptable making the jokes hit harder as well. I didn't think it was always funny but the show does have very sharp dialogue both comedic and otherwise so some of the jokes were able to land and catch me by surprise.  
 
Additionally the series is excellent in terms of atmosphere  and it knows how to make you feel exactly how it wants you to feel whether it's happy, depressed or relaxed. It's all done with great patience. 
 
Visually the show might have a cheap look at first glance since the characters can look a little wonky and off model on occasion and nothing looks particularly detailed. But the reason for this is because the characters have very elaborate motions and expressions quite often. This show goes for a kinetic or movement based style of animation. Although the more the series goes on, and the more depressing it becomes the show does tend to linger on shots more often giving us nicer single images (usually wide shots of empty spaces to convey the main character's loneliness).  
Also the series has Yoshitoshi Abe's distinct character designs, a bright color pallet with lot's of greens and blues, as well as good attention to detail when it comes to the changing of seasons. 
 
In terms of voice acting, everyone sounds like they're giving it their all. As I've said the dialogue in this series is very sharp and character defining and the actors did a good job of selling that. 
Much of the series is quiet and without any music, especially the later half which I quite appreciate. But what music there is are these soft acoustic guitar pieces or pianos. At most you have some wacky comedic music in places and cartoonish sound effects (also there's one insert song by the singer of the OP). 
The OP and ED both seem to fit the series in terms of their lyrics. But the OP just sounds weird and the ED is actually very nice. 
 
Overall this series is brilliant and I feel stupid for not appreciating it when I first watched it only a few short years ago. The characters have real depth, the atmosphere is great, the directing is incredibly efficient and good at telling you exactly what you need to know at any moment without overdoing it. 
It's a little odd and not for everybody, but those who like slice of life should definitely give it a shot. 
 

          
 
       Helpful Ahhhh NieA_7. If you've never heard of this anime I wouldn't blame you. As it is not one of Yoshitoshi ABe's most famous since he is one of the masterminds behind the ever talked about mindf**k that is Serial Experiments Lain. If I had to compare NieA_7 to anything that ABe has done it would be more appropriate to compare it to that of Haibane Renmei as it's not all dark and philosophical, but rather, very calming and easy to take in. This show would best be described as the crew who worked on Lain taking a little break. This show is a very light-hearted comedy that is honestly a joy to watch. I would say I watched it at the perfect time as I got exactly what I wanted out of it since I had watched a lot of anime recently that consist of heavy drama and very compelling storylines. (It was Fate/Zero if you were wondering)  
 
STORY: 8/10 
Some would argue that NieA_7 lacks a constat story, I would disagree. As this anime is about a world where it is the year 2000, the turn of the century, and Aliens live amongst humans. And among those aliens is a girl (an Under Alien) named NieA. She freeloads at the Enohana Bathhouse. The main protagonist of the story is a Cram School student named Mayuko Chigasaki, who works 3 jobs just to get by. She lives at the Enohana Bathhouse with NieA and must deal with NieA crazy shenanigans or just have to deal with NieA constantly complaining about being hungry. The part of the story that I really resonanated with was that it was about Mayuko really trying her hardest to get by and showing all of these overarching depressing themes that ABe throws out there. But at the end of the day, the show is a fun to watch light-hearted comedy. 
 
CHARACTERS: 9/10 
I'll start with Mayuko Chigasaki 
Mayuko is a down on her luck Cram School Student who has to work 3 jobs just to get by as she does not want to bother her parents die money. She barely makes enough to have dinner at night, much to NieA's dismay. While she doesn't make much, she is a very hardworking girl, and never complains about what is asked of her. She constantly is butting heads with NieA wanting to eat all the time or building random UFOs or other contraptions bringing junk into their room. She has another friend named Chiaki (named after Chiaki Konata) whom she hangs out with from time to time. But Mayuko is a generally socially awkward person who would rather stay at home and study than go out with friends. Mayuko came off as a very relatable character and one that I really connected with. While I am not at the same age as her, I just could really feel what she was going through. A lot of the themes presented in this anime are quite depressing and very real. All in all, Mayuko has become one of my favorite female anime characters.  
Now there's NieA 
NieA is an Under Alien (Under 7) who lived in the Enohana Bathhouse before Mayuko got there. She is constantly causing trouble, by gathering random junk in order to make UFOs to sell so she can pay for food that she so desperately covets. When she's not causing trouble, she can be found sleeping on the roof or just being lazy somewhere. She is a very lovable character who just wants to have fun. Her relationship with Mayuko is one that I really enjoyed watching.  
 
ART: 7/10 
The animation was done by Triangle Staff who obviously did Serial Experiments Lain. The animation is what is to be expected from an anime that was made almost 15 years ago. Though the animation can hit some really high points that are very noticeable.  
 
SOUNDS: 8/10 
The sound consists of pretty normal set of tracks with acoustic guitars in the mix. Very calming little soundtrack that fits with the show very well. The opening song features the raspy voice of SION. The OP is an acquired taste but it's up to opinion. Solid voice acting on both ends. In the Japanese dub, Mayuko is played by the same voice actress who did Saber of the Fate/  series.  
 
I would very much recommend this anime for anyone who would like to just take a break with a good light-hearted comedy. Though it is pretty old and the age shows from time to time, if you can get past the older animation, you'll find a real gem of a series.

(Source: bakabt)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Shoujo']","Well, I didn't expect to watch somewhat of a Toy Story movie when I started Fresh, that's for sure. 
 
In the movie of this entry, all the toys are disappearing and our girls have to visit the Kingdom of Toys to face a villain called Toymajin, the one behind all the chaos created. 
 
In all honesty, and despite that I liked it myself, I can perfectly understand anyone who wouldn't like this movie. As it's the case with most of the movies of this type that I have watched, their short run time (and the more or less 10 minutes spent in stock footage of the transformation/movements doesn't help) together with wanting to split the screen time so all the girls get protagonism made the plot quite underdeveloped, but the theme of this movie about the feelings of the toys and why of the actions of Toymajin hit me pretty hard emotionally as someone very weak to those elements. 
 
The art was pretty nice as expected of Precure. This movie uses some CGI in the later parts of the movie but it looked pretty good IMO, the awesome models for the characters already used for the ED dances helps with that quite a lot. The music was the same of the TV series and while it's not too memorable it does a good enough job with adding to the scene. 
 
If you liked Fresh and find the story elements I mentioned interesting enough, this movie is well worth a try, but I recommend to not go with high expectations.

this show takes place after ""beast wars"" and follows the japanese g1 timeline which means that headmasters masterforce and victory and zone are also in this timeline and ignores the season 4 of g1 ""Beast Wars 2"" is essentially a sequel to beast wars and you can watch this without watching any other transformer show beforehand unless you want to get into transformers you will probably not know what a ""Cybertron"" or ""Destron"" is despite having maximal and predacon symbols 
Essentially this takes place in the very far future of beast wars  
we follow our maximal crew lead by ""Lio Convoy"" also known as ""Leo Prime"" who has the ""Convoy"" Rank leading a small group of maximals who have pursued Galvatron (Not the g1 galvatron) to Planet Gaia , Galvatron wants to get some Angolmois Energy while the (im going to call them maximals but they are called cybertrons in japan) maximals fight on planet gaia two androids known as moon and artemis watch over them essentially they like give their comments and stuff  
although not as dark as beast wars there are some clever jokes in it as well 
so lets talk about the artstyle ,  
i guess its kinda cartoony? different from the 3d animation used for beast wars but it also reminds me of gundam for some reason  
Maximals 
Characters Lio convoy is very much like g1 optimus friendly , honorable and a father figure 
""Tasmanian kid"" whom is a repaint of beast wars snarl is like the ""Hot Shot"" (referring to armada) of the show kinda reckless sometimes and kiddy 
""Bighorn"" a hot head because he is a bull.. and he isnt very smart 
""Scuba"" the calm , cool , clever bot who has a cousin by the name if Ikard 
""Diver"" a frog im not sure how to put it but his kind of nerdy? in a way 
(more characters appear but i dont know if it counts as spoilers if i were to mention them) 
Predacons 
""Galvatron"" i kind of find him alittle bland but he has his ambitions 
""Megastorm"" Galvatron's brother who looks up to him and hopes to become the next destron emperor and is a complete fool essentially he is like g1 starscream but not a complete douchebag 
""Starscream"" not the same starscream as the red and blue jet this starscream is loyal and calm with a black and purple colour scheme a repaint of G2 Smokescreen 
""BB"" Roger is the only thing he says i love him , his a repaint of g2 Dreadwing who also has black and purple for his colour scheme and he listens to every order starscream gives him and turns into a stealth bomber 
""Dirge and Thrust"" both of them are not the same as the g1 characters but share the same name and also turn into jets constantly competing with starscream and bb for galvatrons praise 
i think im finished with this review theres also the ""Insectrons"" who fled Cybertron in order to find peace from the war  
 and Sick and tired of the endless wars plaguing Cybertron  
overall story 7 
theres also the movie and i watched this show  twice

       Helpful Since there's no review available on MyAnimeList for the Beast Wars II anime that aired in Japan in 1998 and has been fansubbed since 2016 by Karyuudo Fansubs and can be found on Youtube, I really wanted to be the first to give my own nitpicks about the anime Beast Wars II (read aloud as Beast Wars Second) here on MyAnimeList. This is a spin-off of the Western cartoon Beast Wars: Transformers we probably all loved and aired around the time (Spring 1998) between Beast Wars and Beast Wars Transmetals aired in Japan.  
 
*May contain minor spoilers - incase you aren't familiar with Transformers in general* 
 
The planet Gaia, better known as what we can compair to our own very Earth is home to a powerful but unstable energy source known as Angolmois energy (you can pretty much compair it with lava in my opinion), which has come to attention of the Destrons (or Predacons if you’d prefer, you know the descendants of the Decepticons) being led by Galvatron (not to be confused with the G1 one). The Cybertrons (Maximals) are being led by Lio Convoy, whose mission is to stop Galvatron from extracting the Angolmois Energy and protect the planet Gaia from destruction. Lio Convoy is teamed up by Tasmanian Kid, Diver, Scuba, Big Horn and Apache, while Galvatron’s soldiers include Starscream (not the Starscream G1 one, but a complete other one according to the sourcebook that I own), BB, Dirge, Thrust, the Autorollers and his own younger brother Megastorm. Would Galvatron succeed his plan? Will the Cybertrons (Maximals) stop Galvatron and his team just in time? 
 
Pretty much every Transformers fan knows up on this point “Japanese-made Transformers series” is not a good combination and it has it's good reasons. The fact that it's quite obvious the Transformers franchise only exists for purely one thing; 'to sell toys' (big suprise, huh?) and the Japanese also try to earn some money within the franchise in the form of much more show accurate toys made by TakaraTomy compaired the ones we have gotten by Hasbro. The show itself also aims for a much younger demographic than its Western much darker counterpart. Even though this anime is a fun watch if you really loved Beasts Wars or even the G1 Transformers cartoons. Even though it has a quite boring beginning and I was myself on the verge of dropping the show, but once the ball started rolling the show became much more enjoyable to watch even though with some quite outdated artstyle and re-used clips where our Transformer characters transforms, but once you get past that it's no problem. 
 
The characters are quite enjoyable to watch, despite how childish Beast Wars II can get. I personally loved Scuba, Starscream, BB and the Jointrons the most. The characters Artemis and Moon are two androids who watch over the planet Gaia, frequently commenting on the show’s events and are offering small factoid segments at the end of each episode and would serve almost no real purpose in the plot. The show also has 3 'recap episodes' and it's up to you to skip them if you want. Remember; this show is aimed for childern and is basicly one big toy advertisement just like any other Transformer show basicly is. 
 
Despise it's flaws, I still enjoyed the show and I look forward in late 2018 when Karyuudo Fansubs will have scheduled the release the fansubbed sequal called 'Beast Wars Neo'. 
 
Overal scores: 
Story: 6/10 (Fine) 
Art: 6/10 (Fine) 
Sound: 6/10 (Fine) 
Enjoyment: 7/10 (Good) 
Overall: 7/10 (Good) 
 
Recommed if you're a Transformers fan, especially a Beast Wars fan and when you can get past the childish approach of the show.

19,2873,26,6.514691462,Anime with an ensemble casts,Bible Black Only Version,"Bible Black Only explores the sexual misadventures of the supporting cast from the main Bible Black series. Miss Takashiro reminisces on her demonic capture, Itoh reveals her sadistic side, and Saeki is stalked by her classmates. Bible Black Only is a series of stand-alone episodes that do not affect the continuity of the main Bible Black series, and it contains footage that was previously only available on the R2 Bible Black Perfect Collection DVD. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Hentai'],"This is the Magnum Opus of the Bible Black series. I am sure there are many people who watch this genre for the plot, and this OVA is FULL of it.  
 
I'll do my best not to spoil it, but I was on the edge of my seat for the entire two episodes. For the first episode I was biting my nails as my favorite heroine, Takashiro, goes inside the bathroom. The suspicion was so intense, and you can see the writers knew how to do twists as they have learned from the master known as M. Night Shamaylan. Needless to say it ends on a negative note, but everything in bible Black ends in a negative note so that is not a surprise! 
 
Second episode is where it gets very good though. Instead of going the dark route they went the comedic route. I was laughing so hard when they parodied the three stooges with a trio of girls on their journey. It was heartwarming to the point I didn't know I was looking at hentai and so there is a giant plus.  
 
10/10

          
 
       Helpful If you're expecting a continuation of Bible Black's story, you might want to look somewhere else for it. Bible Black Only bears little relevance on the plot. In fact, aside from the prelude to a sex scene, it's ALL sex scenes.  
 
I suppose the good thing about this is that if you enjoyed the sex scenes in Bible Black, you're in for a treat. Only two of the main characters are involved in them (Being Takashiro and Saeki), while the rest feature characters that made either a small appearance in Bible Black or were missing entirely.  
 
Only two of the sex scenes seem to anything to the story, the first involving Takashiro, invoking a flashback to Bible Black Origins and her sole sex scene (I'm sure you'll remember that...).  
 
The second involves only a couple pictures of Saeki, surprisingly as a member of the school's swim team (which I think is a fabrication; there's no indication of this in the game at all).  
 
Don't get me wrong; it's nice to see Saeki in action again, considering how you get only two such scenes in the original, and one of them might turn off most viewers (you know damn well what I'm talking about).  
 
If you need a hentai fix, watch this. If you care about Bible Black's story, maybe watch the first episode. You're given a small Easter egg, and after that....yeah, it's more or less people screwing.

This is the school where young girls are trained to become Otomes, protectors of royal leaders throughout the lands. Here, Arika makes plenty of friends, but some enemies know something about her past that she does not. Nevertheless, her spirit and determination will keep pushing her forward. 
 
Adapted from its predecessor, Mai-HiME, this series is not a direct sequel, but an alternate universe setting featuring some of the Mai-HiME cast (though with different personalities).

It also answered some questions about what happened to the previous winners of the carnival.  The Main characters were more immature though which was somewhat of a let down. 
 
All in all it was good to see the sequel. 


          
 
       Helpful Haha second review! 
WARNING, there are spoilers in here so if you haven't watched this anime yet then read at your own risk! 
 
no but along with the review.   
Mai-Otome was quite an interesting anime to watch, when i started it out i was saying ""what the heck?!"" quite a little bit because it was interesting how it played out.  Like with the yuri like moments and all of that.  and with Arika' head turning into an ant head whenever Serge called her ""Antsy"".  But even then i stuck with it and i'm happy to say that I had made a good choice with sticking with it.  The storyline for it was very good and the characters where put together quite nicely. The artwork was very nice and pretty crisp.  and the enjoyment i got from this anime was high.  But i'll start to go into the categories for how i rated it now. 
 
Story: 9 
I can understand the story very nicely and it was very good and interesting, albeit a little bit of an overused general theme, Girls in school saving the world.  Yeah a lot of us otaku' have seen that before, but this anime had a lot more to it, the story was cliche but very unique.  And I liked that and enjoyed that very much.  I would have rated this a 10 if there where more episodes but since there are only 26 it's going to be a 9 for me. 
 
Art: 7 
The art was very nice and clean.  It showed everything very nicely and there was some remarkable detail in a lot of things in this anime.  Like with the gems and how they even had the text and that for when the Otomes transformed and used their special attacks.  And Miyu' arm when it changed into the sword had a lot of detail too.  But the thing that brought down my score for the art was when Arika' head turned into an ant head.  It was funny and there was a lot of detail in that but it was just odd to see in an anime and brought my score down a little for it. 
 
Sound: 9 
The voices for the characters takes a couple episodes to get used to (like Shizuru' high voice) but after you get used to their voices you should like them a lot.  I watched the dubbed version.   
The op's for this anime where very nice, the 1st op for it took me a little while to get used to but thats because i was expecting something different at the time, and the ending for it also took me a little while to get used to but after that i very much enjoyed them.  So i'm rating this a 9. 
 
Characters: 10 
I'm rating for the characters a 10 because each character has a very unique personality and a lot of them change in some way during the story.  Like Arika who wanted nothing more but to be an Otome wanted to never transform again when they where in the Aswad camp.  But after she was forced to transform so she could rescue herself and Mashiro she began to love being an Otome again after she started to figure things out.  Nina also changed quite a bit throughout the story, hating Arika, then beginning to be her friend, Despising and hating her again, and then thinking of her as a friend again. 
There is a lot more but i don't want to say too much.  But again i'm rating the characters a 10. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
This anime was very good, and i enjoyed it a lot.  The fighting in it was very good and had me at the edge of my seat, and other moments had me very sad (like when Aoi jumped off of the cliff) and then some had me laughing so hard i was crying.  But this anime is very enjoyable so i'm rating it a 10. 
 
Overall i'm rating this anime a 10/10 because i personally feel like it deserves it.  If you have any complaints or anything to say about my review then feel free to comment on my profile here on mal or PM me but if you like my review then please rate it up ^_^

          
 
       Helpful My-Otome is nothing less than a total disaster as far as I'm concerned. This semi-sequel to 'Mai-Hime' is one of those shows that tries to combine many different genres such as comedy, action and drama into one; but it is a colossal failure in every way imaginable.  
 
The basic story is, like many aspects of the show, incredibly derivative. It's the tale of a young girl named Arika Yumemiya who wants to enter a highly prestigious school called Garderobe where girls are trained to become an Otome, unbelievably powerful warriors who serve as vanguards of a country's militia. It is through a series of bafflingly outrageous coincidences that our young heroine manages to enroll at the normally way out-of-her-league academy and from then on, the story kicks off.  
 
Doesn't sound very original, does it? Well the rest of the plot is every bit as standard: Arika manages to make friends at Hogs- *cough*, I mean 'Garderobe' after a somewhat rough start, she is quickly confronted with all kinds of shady characters, ancient conspiracies are unveiled, hidden lineages are discovered, friends become enemies, enemies become friends and there may also be a love-triangle or two to complicate things along the way. Textbook definition of 'cookie-cutter'. 
 
A complete lack of originality can be compensated for by an outstanding execution; but Mai-Otome falls flat in that area. Main offender is the atrocious plotting. Plot-points and characters are introduced only to get put on hold until several episodes later if not dropped entirely, characters 'die' only to turn up (relatively) unscathed later, things happen for no logical reason other than that they're supposed to happen for the plot to move in the direction the creators envisioned (a character even remarks in one of the later episodes that the way some previous events transpired doesn't make any sense) and well-meaning side characters hold back crucial information that may be of great help to the clueless protagonists only to have said protagonists befall some grave misfortune that could have been prevented if they had been better informed. 
 
And this doesn't just happen once or twice. The series is LOADED with moments like this. Pretty much any scene scene that isn't filled with incredibly cheesy fanservice humor (a particular plot-device essentially serves as a setup for countless scenes of ecchi-humor involving girl-on-girl 'action') or third-rate soap-opera level angst about love and/or the duties and burdens of an Otome from some of the protagonists is how I just described. 
 
It's clear by now that the story didn't keep me watching this; so maybe the action-sequences were able to offer some redeeming value? Sadly they weren't. The fight-scenes are incredibly unimaginative and poorly animated, most of them ending with an Otome obliterating an opponent with her strongest attack. And all of that is assuming that fight scenes do occur on-screen. I say this because the series is filled to the brim with moments where two characters are set up to fight, only to switch to other events just as the fight starts. All of this makes for a viewing-experience that is frustrating at worst and unfulfilling at most, even for the biggest of action-junkies. 
 
Production-values are nothing to write home about. The art and animation are unremarkable at best though I will give the series credit for the catchy opening-tune as well as the fact that the many characters are all easy to distinguish from one another (even if a lot of them are recycled from Mai-Hime). Oh, and some of the attacks have effects that look pretty cool. 
 
Between the awful story and largely unremarkable production-values there's really no reason I to check out this series. Even those who were fond of its predecessor, Mai-Hime (which I found to be entertaining though highly flawed), will find little to love. The new characters are nothing special, the action is less frequent and less impressive despite being much bigger in scope and the returning characters (even though they're actually 'alternate reality' versions) don't develop or contribute to the plot in any meaningful way. There's even one particular character whose personality and abilities are a complete 180 from the way she was in Mai-Hime and several who seem to be thrown in just so fans can point them out. 
 
I could go on and on about the abysmal plotting (like how the main character is defeated by a powerful foe only to get launched to another dimension where she just so happens to meet a powerful figure mentioned earlier in the story who can help her get stronger), the paper-thin and highly archetypical characters (you KNOW there's a problem when the most interesting characters are ones that mostly got their characterization from the previous series), the constant skipping out on action-sequences and the complete lack of any creative ambition whatsoever; but I think I have already made my point very clear so I'll just wrap it up. 
 
Whether you're a fan of Mai-Hime or are just looking for a fun-packed action-adventure series, Mai-Otome is totally derivative, awfully written, largely unfulfilling and completely frustrating series that reeks of being conceived for no other purpose other than to make a quick buck. It's not worth your time. Skip it.

19,2157,28,6.414984549,Anime with an ensemble casts,Koutetsushin Jeeg,"Kotetsushin Jeeg takes place fifty years after the original and features a new cast of characters—primarily the new main character Kenji Kusanagi, a high school student who becomes Kotetsushin Jeeg to fight the sudden reappearance of ""Haniwa Genjin"" (""Haniwa Phantom Gods"", or clay robots) from the Jamada Empire ruled by Queen Himika. Other characters include Tsubaki Tamashiro (grandaughter of Miwa Uzuki); and Kyou Misumi. Other main characters from the original series also appear.","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","A good place to start here is with what Koutetsushin Jeeg does right. It has a good soundtrack. It has some genuinely funny moments. It has an awesome mech design. 
 
However, it's at its core a reboot of a super robot show that, while hugely popular apparently in Italy, is pretty obscure otherwise in the West. It unfortunately references the original a lot, and has appearances from the cast. It's also a little rushed at the end, being only 13 episodes. Some more episodes to flesh out the backstory, introduce the key plot elements of the ending arc and perhaps just to let some of Jeeg's forms get more use would make it a lot better. 
 
It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire. 
 
JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there. 
 
Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths.

          
 
       Helpful Decent show, very much a &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series. The directors even said themselves that it was basically a simplistic mecha show without too many complications and was made mostly as a sequel/tribute to the original Koutetsu Jeeg. Hard-headed, gung-ho pervert protagonist Kenji gets drafted into service by Build Base after he and his friends are enveloped in a weird black mist. He doesn't particularly mind however, because they give him a sweet chopper that turns into the head of a sweet robot, Koutetsu Jeeg, and tell him to go forth and kick butt with them. The plot is essentially a continuation of the events that took place in the original Koutetsu Jeeg, and ties in to said events very well towards the end...most of the cast from the original show show up at some point.  
 
There's sort of a love triangle set up in the beginning, but it very quickly dissipates because Kyo is just mysterious to love anyone, apparently. (You find out why later.) Kenji and friend-that-is-a-girl Tsubaki sort of have a love/hate relationship, but it never really develops until the very end in a very awkward and anticlimactic way. Relationships in this series are for the most part spelled out in stone for the viewer and don't really develop beyond what you see in the first few episodes.  
 
It's a fun series if you're looking for something with lots of action and not a lot of anything else. I didn't go in expecting a deep plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only major complaint is that the end of the series feels very rushed, as if the team didn't want to or didn't have the budget to work on it anymore. The show's namesake, Koutetsushin Jeeg, doesn't even appear until the last episode for all of about three minutes, which is a shame because he's really awesome. Besides that it's a great show that's at least worth giving the three-episode test run if you're a mecha fan.

19,2595,29,6.414984549,Anime with an ensemble casts,D.C.II: Da Capo II,"The undying Sakura Trees return. Based on a PS2 sequel of the original DaCapo game, the story once again takes place on Hatsunejima, but is set 53 years after the events of D.C. and D.C.S.S.. Although some characters will probably look a bit familiar to the initiated eye, the cast is a new one. The new main protagonist is Yoshiyuki Sakurai, who lives next door to the Asakura sisters Yume and Otome, who are the granddaughters of Junichi and Nemu from the first season. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'School']","This is a new Da Capo with an entirely different storyline. I was expecting the least of it since it has a low rating and watching it at first got me confused and disappointed because it was something completely different from the previous ones, but, it turns out great. People must have taken this series the wrong way because it is actually quite good. I've watched it while expecting and searching for disappointments, but the only flaw to it is that it has two main stories which is basically wrong. The stories are great and they indeed, are able to switch between the two like it was dante's weapons in devil may cry 3, but as what everyone learned since elementary, there should ALWAYS be ONLY ONE main topic because it's very hard to talk about two things at the same time. ""EF - A Tale of Memories"" were able to pull it off somehow but this one didn't, still, this is definitely a MUST WATCH, not as a continuation of the previous Da Capo but as a new anime. 
 
The undying Sakura trees do return but they're more like just a background this time. There's a whole new story but sadly its very wrong because they tried to fit two stories into one show. However, when separated, the stories are pretty good. Da Capo II has a story of love between childhood friends and also a story of robots and society. There's also a side story of playing in a band and a hint of the Da Capo harem. There's also this thing about the main guy having dreams just like Junichi in the very first Da Capo. It's really such a waste that they tried a mix of stories here. They took the other things lightly and ended up focusing most on the robot story while trying to keep up with the love story, so it was quite a mess. Anyway, the fact that the stories in separate are good and because it had a very nice ending, the story department still deserves a good score. 
 
The art is very good. Everyone and everything looked nice, but the problem is that it lacked beauty and cuteness. The drawings are good and the animation is good but comparing it to the previous works, the art, most specially the characters, could have looked so much better (the characters look bad in side view). 
 
The sounds are great. It has a nice OP and ED that is well fitted for the genre and it also has nice backgrounds, and nice voices. Everything is well blended with the scenes. The sounds are really good but not to a point that people would like it so much. 
 
To the viewers of the previous Da Capo, the new characters will feel really weird and disappointing since they don't seem to be directly related to the old ones. No history was presented. Disregarding that, the characters were all great and everyone had good roles, except for Sakura Yoshino. Thinking about it, it's quite disappointing that she doesn't have much to do this time. Another bad thing is that the main guy can be too much thickheaded but he was able to make up for that somehow. 
 
Da Capo II could have been great. It's quite enjoyable despite the negative facts. It has the comedy back, it has good drama, and the music band thing was a big plus. Suginami's 100% evasion is something to miss though but it's still fine without it.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The weakest area of DC II. The story really has no backbone. There is some character development. But from what I have watched so far, nothing has changed at all! In nine episodes there has only been roughly 2 solid events: Koko's confession and the trip. 
 
Art: Based off a visual novel just like the previous two seasons, there is not much you can really say about the art work, except its well-drawn. Not that there are any significant differences in style. 
 
Sound: I was pleased with the songs in this season. I enjoyed the OP and ED song alot, as well as a few insert songs. The OST is exceptional so far, and I hope I'll be able to get my hands on it soon. 
 
Character: Not much of a difference between the casts of the First Da Capo and this one. Yes, they very much resemble their ancestors with slight differences. But I thought there are some unnecessary characters this time barely affecting the story at all. Nanaka and Koko are my favorite characters so far, the rest of the cast pretty much OK. 
 
Enjoyment: So far the series ranks an OK, I ll lets keep going, although sometimes I am reluctant. I usually can finish an episode in one sitting, but it actually took the course of almost half a day to a whole day to actually get back on track and resume. 
 
Overall: If it were not for the sound, this anime wouldve ranked much lower than I had reviewed the first season of Da Capo. Not much you can really say, that stands out. I guess this would be the standard for &quot;The Average High School Anime.&quot;

          
 
       Helpful I decided to change my review because I didn't liked it anymore, and I have other things to say now. 
 
Story 
I still say that I can't give the story higher then a 6. I think I'm going to sound very negative now, but I can't help it, sorry. The story is just.. boring! The whole series is about the Koko x Yoshiyuki relationship which isn't going anywhere! We also see some episodes about Minatsu, again, I'm not really interested, but other people can like it. After some episodes I was really forcing myself to watch it.. Like I said, one word: B-O-R-I-N-G. 
 
Art 
I can say something good about this, at least.. There's nothing wrong with the art, we could also see that in the other Da Capo series. Bright colors, nice characterdesign, you can see that this anime is kinda new, that's a good thing, isn't it? 
 
Sound/Seiyuu's 
Nothing wrong with the sound, you can hear it very bright, so.. we can't say bad things about that either. But now we come to the seiyuu's. Some of them.. ANNOY ME! 
Examples: 
Yoshiyuki: If my boyfriend had a voice like that, I would say: Goodbye! That was really harsh, isn't it? Okay, maybe I won't, if I would really love the guy. 
Minatsu: The most annoying voice ever, does she always have a cold or something?! Maybe her seiyuu was sick or something?! 
 
The rest of them, they're fine. Some of them are really good, others are normal, think you understand me, right? 
 
Character 
I like most of Da Capo II's characters. Good ones: Otome, Yume, Nanaka, Anzu, Sakura and the rest who aren't with the bad ones. Bad ones: Yoshiyuki, Koko, Minatsu. Why I don't like Yoshiyuki, Koko and Minatsu? They are the worst main characters they could choose, and the story is mostly about them. Yoshiyuki is way too dense. Koko is annoying and thinks that Yoshiyuki always will see her as the first place, selfish brat. Minatsu acts like she don't need help, so people will feel sorry for her. And WTF is the thing with the bananas? I mean, she (Minatsu) says that she hates them, but she needs to eat them to survive. I mean.. BANANAS! How do they think of something so stupid! Did they ask the greengrocer for help when they thought of this! Horrible.. That this still can get a 7 is because of the 'good ones', and because I'm way to nice! :-) 
 
Enjoyment 
Do you like boring stories with two people who are in a relationship which never will work out? Do you like robots and bananas? Then Da Capo II is the anime for you! Okay, forget what I said.. I can't believe that this crap is from the same makers as the other Da Capo series. Where is the drama?! Even the end s*ckt very badly! We don't know anything yet... I'm not sure if I want to watch the second season of this, it needs to be VERY good otherwise I will drop it right away. But maybe some people enjoyed this, I don't know, I think that there was a episode where Nanaka sings, that one wasn't very bad. 
 
Overall 
I'm sure some of you are wondering why I gave such good notes, because I was really negative if you ask me. 1. I'm way too nice.. 2. Other people may like it, I wanted to watch at their point of view a little..  
My real OPINION: I wasted my damn time on this sh*t! BUT, I'll give the second season ONE chance, maybe they will make up for the crappy story/ending and all the other things. If they won't, I wasted my time even more.  
 
Thanks for spending your time to read this review! Some of you didn't expected Erisu to go evil, neh? :-)

19,6399,30,6.392286812,Anime with an ensemble casts,Higashi no Eden: Falling Down,"Music video by Oasis, animated by Production I.G 
 
The song is also featured as the opening theme song in the anime series, Higashi no Eden, which is also animated by Production I.G.",['Music'],"To put it simply, this is just a music video that can be found on YouTube. If you're a fan or just listening to the british band, Oasis, then this one's for you. 
 
Higashi no Eden: Falling Down can be described as a ""Thank You For Borrowing Your Rights"" gift from Production I.G., who also animated Higashi no Eden, to the british band, Oasis, who sang Falling Down and made it into an OP song to Higashi no Eden, by re-editing the OP scene into a lyric/abstract music video art style. 
 
This 4-minute, 27 seconds of this video is all about the whole song of ""Falling Down"" with a short abstract, yet artistic animation music video about the opening. Also, if you have plans to watch it and Higashi no Eden, but you're concerned about the spoilers, don't worry, there's no spoilers here. It's just a Music Video, no doubt. 
 
If the song convinces you to watch Higashi no Eden, then why not give it a try? It's a great anime nonetheless! ^_^ 
 
(P.S. The reason why I gave 1 for both story and Character because, OBVIOUSLY, there's no plot here. IT'S JUST A MV.)

          
 
       Helpful After watching the series, ""Higashi no Eden"", I made sure I watched the music video.  This music video stays true to the uniqueness of the anime ""Higashi no Eden"" with animation identical to the opening seen in every episode. 
 
The animation is completely amazing and gorgeous; I've never seen anything like it before.  The images and lyrics of the song match perfectly.  There is well-chosen symbolism representing the events of the anime.  I still don't understand all the symbolism...  I like how they incorporate real-life images into the animation like the hand that represents Mr. Outside.   
 
Overall, this is a must-watch for fans.  The images of the video capture me every time.  Glimpses of the outlines of the two main characters are included just like in the opening for the anime.  Actually, a good bit of the animation from the opening is used in the video...I like that about the video, though.  I also like how the lyrics of the song is posted in creative ways throughout the video.  The only downside to the video is that I think it's a little repetitive, but the song is also repetitive which makes sense, I guess.

Battles no matter the gratitude we face them on a daily basis. Toss in added advances in technology doesn't make them go away just changes the order of things. Something that was bad becomes okay, something okay becomes bad. If magic became a real factor on lifes operations my lord the charges that would occur. However, no matter the outcome we must press forward for staying fixated on something is more harmful then good. Such is the basis for this anime. 
 
Story 
-negative note: introduction could have greater flair. 
-positive: Plot was moderate in length it will take a couple bites before getting to the bone.

good characters/ scenes. Good blend to the story. 
 
Sound- no issues 
 
Characters 
Good background for most of the main players. Although, with one of the girl character's her story was a bit off putting when she found her alleged 'purpose'. Having that play out could have greatly improved the performance of the movie.

No clue on what group would get a kick of this. Perhaps, if you enjoy futuristic abilities this may be up your alley.

          
 
       Helpful I'm impressed with this more than possibly any anime I have ever seen. They did so much with just three episodes. This was short, even for something like a film. And yet they filled it with story &amp; action &amp; twists &amp; drama &amp; it's just so amazing. More anime should be like this!  
 
Considering the short amount of anime the story was quite impressive. IE there was one. Little stories building up a living breathing world &amp; a story not without a few twists along the way. Some felt a little forced or rushed. But what do you expect from something so short? You'll however be pleasantly surprised. Maybe I just set my standards to low?  
 
The art's really good too. Amazing designs on the Molds &amp; on the enemies &amp; the tech &amp; just about everything really. It was a shame that the weapons only really amounted to flame throwers &amp; yet looked a lot like gatling guns or mech weapons... And we didn't see more Mold's or more specials (one didn't even have a name!) but it all still looked good, just shame there wasn't more. But what do you expect? 
 
And the enemies, Jesus, they go from creepy to plain fucked up, really amazing work &amp; detail.   
 
The characters are maybe the weakest aspect. I would say, what do you expect? But for what is here, the story is damn good, why can't the characters be too? Although the designs are interesting it ultimately amounted to a series of anime archetypes in a line. Meh.  
 
Now for the amount of anime here, I would whole heartedly recommend this. You will probably set your standards quite low, all for the better! The art is damn fucking awesome. The details are just wow. And the story will probably really surprise you too. A lot happens. It's a rollercoaster of a journey &amp; much like a rollercoaster it's over in a blink of an eye. But hell, that short amount of time will be some of the most fun you'll ever have in your life. Same goes for this!  
 
It's like a brilliant mixture of D.Gray-Man, FMA &amp; Fallout. SO. MUCH. WIN. Go, watch, NOW.

19,37254,32,6.366266906,Anime with an ensemble casts,Last Period: Owarinaki Rasen no Monogatari,"""Period"" is how magic users called who beat ""Spiral""—monsters that were summoned from isolation. Due to the rise of these beings, 14-year-old apprentice Period Haru, who is a part of the Eighth Arc-end Division, is called to break the cycle and cast himself into the endless battle. However, a mysterious thievery occurred and sank the division into bankruptcy, forcing Haru and his other comrades have to leave their headquarters. To rebuild a branch, they have to overcome quest after quest. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']","Last Period is J.C.Staff's take on Konosuba with the gacha-like ""Happy Elements"" elementary skills that are sprinkled in for some insane kind of fun. And therefore, it's not surprising that many game adaptations bear close resemblance to the actual games that they come from, but few come close in between, and this is a good derivative. 
 
The first thing that is noticed with gacha game adaptations will be the monotone characters and the same settings (albeit with a background or sprite hack of the same thing, e.g. just look at the same mayor with different personalities alike)...at least in theory. 
 
The characters are really nothing special, whilst they do have their traits, and TL;DR, they are unique into serving their roles while providing some comedy in their adventures across the world that they reside in. Yes, they can be dumb and indecisive at times, but that's what bonds them together as a team, unwavering at the challenges on their way. And to the forefront, the memes carried out here (especially by Choco) are literally the fourth-wall breaking jokes that resonate with us when the show comes to pivotal points that doesn't click but able to join amongst the monotonous dialogue. 
 
As expected of J.C.Staff, I have no idea why they decided to helm this project, probably because the final product wouldn't look any better...but what a heck of a job they have done here. The bright, colourful and artistic elements play well here and I have to say, this doesn't contend with the quality that they have done for shows in the past, but it still shines here. 
 
And the music...one good, one bad, nah no kidding, they are both good. The OP by Haru and Choco is just plain easy and delightful enough to keep listening to (for at least an hour or 2 on end) while the ED by Wiseman really fleshes out the crew and its wackiness. 
 
Last Period is a decent but good comedy that flew under the radar for some reason. So unless you could care about repeating lines and comedy, gag jokes that just gloss over without you realizing that it is, this show is really hard to recommend. If all you ever want is light-hearted comedy that binds well to the overall setting, check this one out.

          
 
       Helpful I cannot possibly bring myself to rate this at higher than 4/10 after thinking through all the good and bad parts of this show. I feel like the overall rating of this show should be around a point lower than it is now, it doesn't deserve even a 6.61/10 score. 
 
This thing is just so damn insipid. It's seemingly supposed to make fun of, or otherwise show, jrpg mechanics and I do recognize all the jokes where it tries to be funny since I've played my fair share of games, I just don't find them to be that amusing. There were a few funny parts here and there, but most of the time I just find it to be a miracle that I even managed to sit through all 12 episodes. Some episodes had to be put on twice the speed just to get done sooner, that's how bad it was sometimes. 
 
Here we have a boring cast of characters and most of them just makes me cringe, hard. Especially the ""wisemen"" which is kind of like a team rocket who wins more, but they're seriously incompetent and stupid, yet so are the main character&company, so I guess they make a good fit for eachother. That doesn't change the fact that they're annoying and just gets in the way by always repeating the same scenario where they arrive to steal the request the mc&company was going to do, yet they're utterly worthless and just has a chance because they can summon super strong people randomly, it would've been more interesting if they did something with their own powers instead. Then we have the ""boss"" character that is playing around as both the leader of the wisemen and the leader of the main character&company. It's just that I see no reason for her to do so and it's just boring, not even when it's kinda explained a little around episode 12, it makes no sense whatsoever, being utterly moronic. 
 
This anime had the POTENTIAL to be hilarious, but the subpar, tasteless jokes and overall irritating characters and ""plot points"" make sure that it's anything but. The ""story"" or whatever we should call it is just so lacking and it's easy to see that the creators made no effort with it. I mean, look at this one episode where they won a lot of money, somehow two of the main team becomes even more retarded than usual and starts to act like newly rich morons while pretending to be all high and mighty, holding a contest of wealth and ultimately having their servants or similar run away with all their money, even the main headquarters has everyone they hired/employed steal their money too, so they're back to the run-down shithole... AGAIN, since this happened at the start of the anime as well. Even the one who didn't partake in the whole thing, the mc, was robbed of all his wealth, I mean come on? These people aren't just retarded, they're brain dead and not in a funny way, it's just frustrating and boring to see such morons, cringeworthy is the only thing I can describe it with. 
 
Sigh, really. It doesn't help that the subtitles are kind of half-arsed, freely edited and making their own jokes that they think are ""funny"". Especially the copy-paste mayors/village elders which ends their sentences weirdly usually have subtitles completely different from what they're actually saying. I'm all for translators that change things slightly to flow better as long as the original meaning is still there as that is what a good translator should do at times, but changing something completely and inserting their own jokes? Do these guys know what a freaking translator is?  
 
In the end, I kind of liked the setting of this anime, it's just that it's so badly done with dry jokes and borderline obnoxious characters along with cringeworthy events that I barely managed to watch through it. Just a few episodes were actually worth watching, maybe around three episodes. The story is a 1/10, the art is a 7/10(pretty good), the sound is a 6/10, the characters are a 2/10 and my enjoyment is at most a 4/10, so I'll just give it a 4/10 overall. At certain episodes, it can spike to 7 or even 8/10 and be quite enjoyable(such as episode 10 where they somehow end up in different mobile games from their original one, that was relatively interesting, absolutely not funnier than the other episodes, just more interesting, though it ended with an episode reset, that is, the different mobile game world thing was never solved and instead just ended with the episode as if it never happened), but other than those it's not worth watching. This anime would've done better as as 10 minute episodes with a higher pace, actually, I recommend watching the entire thing at 2x the speed! That way, it's more bearable and isn't as much of a chore to watch. Trust me, you'll miss absolutely none of the entertainment this way and it won't degrade the anime in anyway, it'll just improve it. 
 
In the end, I guess that this anime is made for teenagers or children alone. People with low standards for humor and who doesn't think about stuff while watching, just absorbing it like the empty sponges they are. People who actually think that ending a sentence weirdly or characters being absolute morons for no reason whatsoever to the point where you wonder if their brains are truly seriously damaged is the most hilarious shit they've ever seen and not just tired, dry crap that they've seen a million times before and nowadays is just annoying. If I watched this when I was 10-15, I might've found this to be a good laugh trip, but at 23 after going through thousands of manga, novels and anime, it's just garbage. I wish I could go back to the time when I was able to enjoy anything and everything, even subpar shoujo manga I found in the library that I now almost faint and foam at the mouth after trying to read a single chapter of. So, take my review with a grain of salt, if you're younger or haven't gone through that many anime/manga/novels, you might actually find this to be good enough for a 7-8/10 score.

          
 
       Helpful [Disclaimer: This review was originally posted on May 4, 2018, after four episodes had aired. It has been deleted and then re-uploaded so that it doesn't get buried as a preliminary. However, no major changes were made to the review, as Last Period was consistent throughout its run, so no new points needed to be made.] 
 
If you’re ever unsure about watching something because it’s unpopular and has a low MAL score, here’s my suggestion: you should take one of your hands and quickly slap yourself in the face with it. Repeat this action until you have it burned into you that this is not a good way to judge anime. 
 
But, skepticism is always welcome, so if you’re just here to gauge opinions, here’s one: Last Period is one of the best anime of the season, as someone who tends to be a pretty big fan of comedies. I even thought Aho-Girl was funny, but maybe that was just me relating to cataclysmic autism. 
 
If you’re one of the many who love KonoSuba, or one of the few who watched Mahoujin Guru-Guru, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t like this one too. Is it as good as either of them? In ways, no, but that’s not exactly the point. The point is, it’s very much like those anime: a comedic adventure with lots of RPG elements, weird and quirky side characters, and the occasional meta joke.  
 
Last Period has more of an emphasis on meta jokes. One of the main characters, Choco, is acutely aware of being in a late-night TV anime that probably sucks dick according to normal standards, and takes pot shots at it with no mercy. (“Cramming money jokes into a guy’s dialogue is lazy writing.”) She is literally referred to as “Meme Girl” by one of the other characters at one point. Lots of it is clearly obvious for the sake of the anime being more fun, but there are some more subtle jokes as well, such as gachas being complete bullshit. 
 
Also, the Higurashi characters make a cameo. No, really. 
 
It’s clearly an anime that just wants to have fun with itself and doesn’t really try to impress with any sort of plot or character development. And that’s completely fine, because it comes with a lot of heart. There’s a Team Rocket knockoff called Wiseman: a trio of girls with a talking mascot, who questionably serve as the recurring villains of the series. They show up, cause some hijinks, and suddenly leave without really doing anything. There’s not much of an explanation or reason for them to exist, but there’s something genuine and nice about how playful their personalities are--even if you can combine them all as one character (which is kinda the point).  
 
I can’t exactly sell you the character of Wiseman in the form of a written review; in fact, I can’t really sell any character in this anime because none of them have particularly strong personalities by themselves--with the exception of Choco, whose presence is almost always some sort of oddity due to her constant deadpan look and repeated memespouting. That doesn’t mean they’re bad characters, because they work perfectly well in this series. What they lack in development, they make up for in charisma. They bounce dialogue off each other well, everyone has their own quick, witty comments to make; they don’t feel awkward or dull despite their lack of depth, which is why I say they work for the anime itself. 
 
It also helps that the character designs are super strong--like, good god does this anime have some gorgeous women. It’s about an average J.C. Staff production, so it’s not spectacular, but they maintain a respectable level of quality. Said character designs remain crisp and well-made, similar to Amanchu and also Shokugeki before it turned into a grade school powerpoint. It also features some pretty cute monsters that look like Pokemon. 
 
Also the anime has music and voice acting so 7/10 sound please click helpful on my review. The ED is really, really good though because Wiseman sings (sing?) it and the one with the glasses is hotter than two fire ants fucking in a desert. IDK where I was going with this paragraph or this review because I fell asleep while writing it and don’t care anymore but it needs to be posted because I saw that Last Period was getting shit on for no reason and felt the need to give my objectively subjective opinion on why everyone but me is wrong. It’s a good show.

I thought the characters were wonderful, I liked all of them except Doji. I was really into the story, especially when Ryuga came in.

To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself! 
Storyline - 4.9/5. 
 
I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put. 
 
Setting - 9.7/10. 
 
The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5. 
 
Art - 10/10 
 
Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time! 
 
Sound - 5/10 
 
Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess. 
 
Character(s) - 10. 
 
I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros! 
 
Overall - 10 
  
I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women?

       Helpful This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.  
 
Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full. 
 
Story: 5 
The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.

I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.  
 
Character: 7 
The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.  
 
Overall: 6 
5+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4 
That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.  
I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.  
 
Story: 
The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one. 
 
Art: 
Probably not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.  
 
Sound: 
A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in. 
 
Character: 
There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.  
 
Enjoyment: 
Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season. 
 
Overall: 
A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters.

19,40480,35,6.015213948,Anime with an ensemble casts,Sound & Fury,"In this anime visual album, a mysterious driver heads deep into a post-apocalyptic hellscape toward a ferocious showdown with two monstrous opponents. Various studios participated in creating 10 'episodes' for the visual album. Ranging from 3D animation, to 2D animation, to live-action. 
 
(Source: Netflix)","['Sci-Fi', 'Music', 'Samurai']","There was literally no review to this so i decided to do one by myself. It's the very first one that i'm writing here so i'll assume it's gonna be poor. Anyway, let's start: 
 
Story: As it's the music video, the story doesn't play such a big role here. Let's just say it's about samurai looking for revenge (pretty cliche) and about useless violence in the world. That's it. Nothing special, but still it's a music video so it doesn't matter that much. 5/10 
 
Art: Even tho almost every single episode is made of different art, there is CGI almost in every one of them leaving us with like 2 episodes with pure 2d animation. What can I say? It's made by Netflix, c'mon. 4/10 
 
Sound: It's not the type of music that i like, but i'd have to say it's not bad either. Google says it's blues rock, psychedelic rock, boogie rock, and synth-rock. 6/10 
 
Characters: It's the same case as with story here. It doesn't matter since it's a music video. 5/10 
 
Enjoyment: Well this one really depends on your liking towards rock music and it's subgenres. Also you have to have high tolerance for CGI graphics. 
In my case it's 5/10 
 
Overall: Whether you should watch it or not depends pretty much on your music taste. I started to get bored in the middle of the show. I'd recommend it only to those of you who are rock fans. 5/10 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I believe this is the first time I've heard of an anime visual album. I went into this Netflix original relatively blind, and it turned out to be pretty decent. If you've seen Ninja Batman, then Sound & Fury here will look and feel nearly identical since the two share work from the same studio and some main staff members. 
 
First things first, I think the music was pretty great. It's mostly blues and synth-rock throughout. If you're into those or similar rock subgenres, then you'll most likely find more enjoyment in this. There's not much to say storywise. ""A mysterious driver heads deep into a post-apocalyptic hellscape toward a ferocious showdown with two monstrous opponents."" That single sentence from the synopsis about sums it up. These are very straightforward music videos, so don't expect much in the narrative department. The same applies for characterization. It's also absolutely bare bones, but it's passable for what it is. 
 
The use of CGI is very prevalent here. It's actually not too bad. Some parts looked quite good, while others looked somewhat janky and lackluster, but it holds up for the most part. The visuals went well with the songs and the changing art styles kept things interesting. I'd say the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th parts were the best. ""Remember to Breathe"", ""Sing Along"" and ""Best Clockmaker on Mars"" respectively. They were the more visually striking, action-packed, and dynamic scenes in my eyes. I didn't care for the 4th one too much because the synchronized dancing and overall goofiness was a bit much for me. The live-action bits were pretty standard fare.  
 
While these 10 parts were mostly well done, they all lacked substance. There's really not much to them beyond some notable art and some cool, fast-paced action scenes. You should be fine if you go into this for the visual and musical ride alone. Overall, Sound & Fury is not the best or most experimental I've seen concerning anime music videos, but it certainly has enough flair of its own, and is still worth a solid watch.

          
 
       Helpful Lets get to the best part about this film first and foremost.  The 3D Animation and art style is gritty and awe inspiring in some parts. However and can lose focus at some points turning more into a psychedelic trip and losing the tone it recently had set. For 3D animation in Anime usually has a connotation of being a bad thing that doesn't mix but in recent time has gotten better and this film displays some positive light on why some 3D animation could be good. But its still not flawless. Next is the music which is hands down the best part about this film and the only reason you would watch it all the way through. But having this be the highlight of your film is odd to say the least. Because if right off the bat, if you don't like the music then there really isn't anymore of a reason to try to continue ""watching"". Where it really falls apart is the story. There is and there isn't one. I think I can speak for everyone that was trying to follow along subtle hints and stuff in the beginning. But once your main character is driving towards the huge tyrant vehicles one with a money grubbing gun freak and the other a pompous guy who is all about smoking poison. Once you hit the freeze frame at around the 10 minute mark and the movie goes into a weird psychedelic dance scene. All brain cells go out of the window and your just in it for the music and the set peaces. So overall enjoyment was fine for what it was. However I just feel like they could've gotten a more emotional pull from people had they focused a little bit more on story telling. I really enjoy things that don't outright explain everything that is going on but just set the world and drop subtle things here and there. Then really rely on the viewer to try to put things together almost like becoming a conspiracy theorist with visual storytelling. The fact that this Film did not do that. I felt was a very big oversight.

19,1865,36,5.945375649,Anime with an ensemble casts,Getsumen To Heiki Mina,"An animated spin-off from the Densha Otoko (Trainman) TV drama. 
 
In the drama, actor Itoh Atsushi plays the otaku Yamada, whose main love in life is the Mina anime, a cutesy busty heroine with floppy rabbit ears and carrots sticking out her rear. 
 
Mina itself is a character homage which triggers back to the Daicon Animation done by GAINAX where a similar nameless bunny girl appeared. Densha Otoko futher featured an opening with scenes which were appearing back in the Daicon Animation. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Sci-Fi']","This is the dumbest show I've ever seen. 
 
""The writers must have been on drugs"" is a phrase used to describe a show that's bizarre or incoherent. Of course, drugs have the potential to alter the conscious mind, and many writers have created great stories under the influence. I fear, however, that the writers of Getsumen To Heiki Mina were not taking any vision-creating drugs, but were subject to the constraints and conformity of modern-day anime. And they had no ideas. 
 
The plot, if you can call it that, is an asinine collection of monster-of-the-week bits, where the monsters are actually space rabbits who want to interfere with Earth sporting events. 
 
Yeah, you read that correctly. 
 
The only thing this show has going for it, aside from its seldom-occuring humor, is the kind-of-cool characters and their stories - mostly the main character. However, with the short length of this show, the characters appear - and reveal themselves to be part of the ""good team"" - in less than a whole episode. Pretty much every female supporting character becomes a rabbit warrior, sometimes by such random means as being thrown into a tomato patch and having the fruit fall into their mouth (which happens to be the catalyst for transformation). Not that we're expecting realism from this show, anyway. 
 
The worst part of this show is that it's completely boring. The plot setups are always so farfetched and unnecessarily complicated that the audience's response will invariably be ""gee, I guess the writers didn't have any good ideas."" 
 
If you're planning to watch this show because it's a Densha Otoko spinoff, prepare to be disappointed. Otherwise... well, you can see for yourself.

          
 
       Helpful OK, my second review for the day :&gt; this time it's Getsumen To Heiki Miina. 
I think this series is overlooked by many. It's actually pretty good and entertaining, and has the ability to keep your interest for the whole season because it is somewhat different to other series in the same genre as it. 
And also, considering that it's a spin-off from a TV show, I think it did pretty well :&gt; 
 
Story 
OK, we've all seen it before: teenaged girl is generally failing at life, but through some strange circumstances she aquires superpowers and turns her life right around. Well, this series has that too, but it's not quite as dull and drawn out as in other series like it. Firstly, it is 11 episodes long, so there are no stupid and pointless filler episodes. 
Basically, because Mina, the lead female, is a news reporter and isn't a complete cry-baby (think Sailor Moon lol), Getsumen's story is nicely new and fresh, but also staying similar to what we know. Also, the girls are bunnygirls XD 
 
Art 
Standard. Not much shading on the characters, the eyes are usually too small for the face, the backgrounds aren't really noticeable.... but the transformation sequences are top notch. All the Miinas that get a transformation have really nice ones with a lot of detail in them :&gt; nice colours too, so we don't all get eye cancer ;3 
 
Sound 
The OP and ED aren't like most other songs used in magical girl series. I don't know how really, but they're a lot less... cutesy and j-pop, if you get what I mean :S they're really fantastic and fit in pretty well with the series, which quite a few series have failed to manage. 
 
Character 
Mina is kind of standard really. She is hard-working and often over-works herself for the sake of her job; this kind of character is commonly seen in shoujo anime so she doesn't stand out very much really. However, that kind of character is really needed for this kind of show, so I guess it can't be helped. Plus, she's loveable &lt;3 
None of the other characters really got any development though... the other Miinas, not including Ootsuki Miina, don't get any more screen time after their inital appearence. They might pop up like, twice, throughout the series for a couple of seconds, but apart from that the only time you'll see them again is right at the end of the final episode. That's all that disappointed me.  
 
Enjoyment 
I loved it. I patiently waited for months between each episode being subbed because I really liked the series; if it had been any other I would have given up and dropped it. You get a really lovely &quot;feel-good&quot; feeling when watching this, and that's just what I needed at the time ^^ I'll always accept a second season X3

19,6945,37,5.940128106,Anime with an ensemble casts,Gintama: Shiroyasha Koutan,"According to Aniplex, a 10min short anime of Gintama ""Shiroyasha Koutan"" will be released on September 30th. It was shown at Jump Super Anime Tour 2008 and had never been released as a DVD. 
 
It's a trailer of an imaginary Gintama movie. Gintama OVA shown at Jump Anime Tour '05 is also included in the DVD.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Parody']","To sum it up simply, the first 3-4 minutes is presented in a serious and somewhat epic manner, revealing a bit of character background and story, along with great quality fighting scenes and of course heartmoving dialogue.  
 
The next part is basically the usual gintama humor and gags that is still in high standards, including the appearance of many adored characters of the Anime. A fitting choice of music played during the start of the 'movie trailer' and as expected of Gintama, it sent us off laughing with the One piece and Dondake ending. 
 
Of course, it's not subbed yet so only the first part is actually somewhat understandable unless you're fluent in japanese. Never-the-less a great OVA to watch.

          
 
       Helpful Sunrise recognised the demand for a Gintama movie and so took the concept of a teaser, expanded it a little and made Shiroyasha Koutan for the 2008 Jump Anime Tour event. With only a little information and the runtime to go on, many fans assumed the special would be ten full minutes of action - perhaps a full sequence - set during the Joui war, possibly covering sections of main character Gintoki's past. The end result was completely unexpected, but so in Gintama's nature and an absolute treat for fans. 
 
In essence, Shiroyasha Koutan is simply a build up; a supporting act before the main event. The first four minutes are beautifully re-animated backstory sequences from the main series, spliced with additional footage here and there, that have been pieced together to create a trailer for a fictional Gintama movie. Once the trailer is over, we find ourselves in the movie threatre with the main trio, who begin to eliminate the fourth wall in true Gintama fashion by commenting on their own trailer. Before long the supporting cast show up and havoc ensues, then - time's up! It's over. As the characters bid farewell, they reveal the true purpose of the special; to build up the momentum for the One Piece special that follows! 
 
Shiroyasha Koutan is a completely unpredictable, absolutely frantic ten minutes, as funny and entertaining as Gintama ever was; positively up to standard. The animation is crisp and feature-worthy and all of the main characters and every member of the prime supporting cast are utulised; not one character is underplayed. It's pure entertainment in true Gintama form; if you're new to the series, it'll most likely go over your head, but if you're already a fan, it'll go straight to your heart.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Dementia', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Music', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Supernatural']","(This review is based on the assumption you have not watched these already. I will explain the four current shorts briefly without spoilers, so you can get an idea if you want to watch these or not.) 
 
Edit: As this review was posted at the time where only four shorts under this franchise were released, I will update and review the other titles after I have watched them and caught up. Thanks, feel free to read the current four posted here. 
 
 
This is a very interesting set of shorts, and it's the first time I've every approached something in this genre. I've never written a review before, but I figured I'd make one because there aren't any on this site at the moment, so if this can help someone that'd be great. Let's get started. 
 
At the moment, there are four shorts: The Dragon Dentist ,Hill Climb Girl ,Me!Me!Me! ,and Carnage. I'm going to give my brief thoughts on all of these separately below. 
 
Dragon Dentist is a very interesting short. It has a concept on... well... a dragon, and some people who appear to be training to become the dragon's dentists. The short has an interesting concept dabbling in different realms of some sort, interesting and good, but not my favorite of the shorts. Moving on. 7/10 
 
Hill climb is about climbing hills, if you couldn't guess that. It follows the journey spanning about two days of a school girl who loves bicycles, and she seems to be racing her friend every morning to school. This short has a CGI style that is similar to that of RWBY, the characters don't look like your traditional or modern anime, but they don't look bad. If you like racing anime, this might interest you. 7/10 
 
Next is Me!Me!Me!, my favorite of the current four. It follows a story of the main characters inner struggles with a hallucination. This short has the most superior animation out of the group, and is actually quite impressive. The themes are very odd at first, but there really are some deep concepts here if you're looking for something to really interpret and think about after watching. I think almost everything is symbolic for something if you really look at it. It shoulders some themes of purity/diluted views and loss and regret. 9/10 
 
Finally, is Carnage. This is a very interesting short indeed. It follows the story of a girl in an old western setting who has lost her arm, and concerns the path she takes for revenge. I won't say much more, because anything else would pretty much spoil most of the plot. 8/10. 
 
Overall I give this an 8, being very good. I tend to rank things rather highly though; if I liked something, it usually scores high. Maybe I'm being a little generous with an 8, but the shorts are worth a watch although Me!Me!Me! and Carnage are both very graphic and contain nudity, so if you don't like that, just watch the first two. Those are pretty much clean, although do not have as heavy of an effect as the later.

          
 
       Helpful Now before we get into this I just want to take the time to say this is my first review so have mercy. 
 
Now if your wondering ""Yo what's up with this Nihon Animator Mihonichi?"" Well look no further as I'm hear to give you a general idea of what this collection of short films has to offer. 
 
Story: 
Let us begin with the stories of Nihon Animator, I feel that there is a special short film waiting for everyone in this collection. There is a huge variety of types of stories that are told here, some are just little fun shorts to watch while others have a deeper meaning. Some are happy and others are sad, some are simple and others make you think. I believe this is the best feature in this collection because you can connect to a bigger audience. There might be some short films that are not for you in this collection, there will be some shorts that just end without an explanation but this also makes you think harder about the film which is what I think they want you to do. I don't want to talk about any of the films, because first of spoilers and second off its interesting going into this with no clue what you are going to get. (Nihon Animator is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get.) So I will just let you experience the shorts for yourself.   
 
Art: 
The art of this collection is exactly how I explained the stories.  Each short film has its own unique art style put into it. It really comes down to the watcher's opinion on art whether they think it is good or bad.  I think this also adds to the feeling the short film gives off, so it makes the experience all the much more unique. 
 
Sound: 
I think the music will have a strong impact on the viewer because most of it captures the feeling of the short film its in. Also the voice acting was good so thats always a plus. 
 
My Thoughts: 
There were some shorts that I didn't care for but I understand that they were not meant for me so I didn't judge them too hard. Some of the music in this collection is AMAZING! *cough* ME!ME!ME! *cough* Girl *cough* There are alot of beautiful visuals in this collection. After finishing all of these short films it feels as if I've been on a journey. I had so many feelings felt when watching all these short films: happy, sad, confused, relaxed, and weirded out at some points but I'm glad that I watched all of Nihon Animator Mihonichi and I hope you feel the same way by the time you finish it. 

          
 
       Helpful Why do we watch anime? Some people for the characters, some for the stories, others for the culture. But hopefully all of us can get an appreciation for some gorgeous, if brief animation, right? Of course, that fails to do NAM justice. 
 
Nihon Animator Mihonichi plays host to a number of unrelated shorts with storytelling as varied as the artstyles of each piece. The one common factor is that the stories themselves are rarely direct and you'd be forgiven for wanting to watch it again until you have an understanding for what it is. This isn't a bad thing, as it's sign of the rare occasion where quality has been condensed into a brief seven minutes. Quite like the budget. The first short is about a girl who's hoping to become a Dragon's dentist (quite literally) and the requirements and training to be one involve her dying on the battlefield. Are you lost? It makes contextual sense by the end, but you'll want to watch it and a lot of the others (The infamous ME!ME!ME!) at least a second time or recall upon them in your memory banks a few hours later at work, school, or just while having a drink. 
 
The animation alone is why I personally keep watching. Even when a story doesn't invoke my attention enough or fails to impress me from a story level, the animation is always expressive in one way or another. Hill Climb Girl, for instance, utilizes pure CGI, but it's nigh flawless on its own, while Carnage is not done justice by words. Others utilize still images, these ones being those directly related to actual full-length anime, i.e. the Gundam and Evangelion franchises. They're interesting in their own right and, especially if you're a fan, should take a look at. 
 
This is where I should mention the naked breasts. 
 
Following the third and currently infamous ""ME!ME!ME!"", which uses so much sexual symbolism to the point of numbing the viewer to it within its short run time or bringing a more sensitive person to smash their computer, two of the next, and presumably some in the future, contain nudity. Quite a bit, in some cases. While I'd personally call ""ME!ME!ME!""'s breast turrets as enough a sign of satire as any, Carnage and 20 Min Walk should convince you with their artstyles that it is not so much along the lines of fanservice as an artistic appreciation for the human body, such as art used to contain before the idea of sexualization confused people on what ""offensively sexualized"" even meant. I digress. If you think you should skip the third, do it. You won't lose much except the chance to send a link to terrorize coworkers, parents, and normal people with. 
 
And after those two, the rest is pretty simple. The sound that is available is synched to the visuals in a way that works, though is rarely memorable. When it is, it usually has to do with the fact that it was designed around being a music video. See #10. YAMADELOID for an example. For character, well, with little dialogue I can't say you'll meet with complicated psyches too often, but the characterization certainly doesn't make these guys unlikable as the 6-7 minute video takes them through the one task they want or need to accomplish. 
 
And do I enjoy it? Christ, yes. The videos flow beautifully and I can't find a single time they're boring. If you were skeptical at first about watching these, here's a somewhat spoilerific synopsis of a few. 
 
1. A tale reminiscent of a military training video, with more than a few direct parallels, joined with fantasy elements for that much more intrigue. 
2. Training leads to success, as one schoolgirl and the daily challenge she holds with her friend encourages her to push herself to her limits. 
3. An otaku lies in bed as memories of his past and present torment him. 
4. A one-armed girl who seeks vengeance takes it to the church. 
5. A number of still frames taken from the animation studios of the original Mobile Suit Gundam team are put up next to each other slowly for the audience to observe the process of animation itself. 
 
If any of these interest you, I cannot give you a higher recommendation than to continue with the rest. Keep in mind, Studio Trigger was responsible for the animation of the 11th. It, at the least, is worth a gander.

19,508,40,5.875444829,Anime with an ensemble casts,Tottoko Hamtarou,"He's small, fluffy, and absolutely adorable: Hamtarou is one perfect little hamster! After moving to a new house with his owner, 5th grader HirokoHaruna, Hamtarou discovers other hamsters and quickly makes friends. 
 
The group of hamster explorers call themselves the Ham-Hams, and there's nowhere they won't go. The Ham-Hams go on crazy adventures all around the city while their owners are away, visiting everything from plays to magical lands of candy. Meanwhile, the humans face their own dramas.. 
 
Hamtarou meets a huge cast of different personalities, gets himself into—and out of—some pretty tight spots, and even helps Hiroko and her friends out more than once. Through it all, he never stops being unbearably cute. It's Hamtarou time!","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Kids']","Oh, my childhood. Where did you go? 
 
Let me begin my review by acknowledging (and hopefully resisting) a little bit of bias. Hamtaro was the very first anime series I ever saw. I started watching it when it was still airing on Cartoon Network in 2001; I was only three years old, so I suppose it's understandable that I fell in love with it. I don't feel like I should list myself as having watched any episodes, since I don't remember any of them in particular, but for many years, Hamtaro was my life. I would try to get up early every morning so I could watch it in the 6:30 slot before preschool. 
 
I only just discovered, today actually, that after the dub ended in 2002, the series kept running in its native Japan until 2006, and I am here to tell you that if I had known that, I would have gotten into subbed anime much sooner. Hamtaro, as a whole, is a beautiful series, in so many different ways. 
 
The story and character get a perfect ten from me for obvious reasons. Hamtaro brought out liveliness, kindness, adventure, and even childlike romance, all things a children's series tries to have, and it blew those topics out of the water. Not only is the title character courageous and adventurous, he's a bit naive, which makes him even more adorable. 
 
Art and sound...not quite so perfect, but understandable given the target audience. Children are going to love this series whether it looks like a hundred-million-dollar budget movie or not. 
 
Enjoyment? I believe I already acknowledged that area. 
 
The overall score is what it should be, in my opinion. Hamtaro is what every child longs for in a television series, and Ritsuko Kawai delivered. You don't see many anime series that live on ten years after they end, but yet, here we are today. At the time of writing, I am already making plans to get back into this series almost fifteen years after the last time I saw it. 
 
Tottoko Hamtarou, you gave me my childhood. Now, I feel like I'm right back in it, and it was the best time of my life.

          
 
       Helpful What can I say? I'm a fan boy! 
 
But my review is honestly what I think this series deserves--it is a perfect mix of everything anime is suppose to be. There is a bit of everything from time to time: romance, action, humour, suspense, seriousness, etc. 
 
The series is most enjoyable in the original form (Tottoko Hamutaro) as I find the voice acting much better, and the sound EXTREMELY better. It has, by far, the BEST OST soundtrack of any anime I've ever heard, surpassing the likes of One Piece by a mile. 
 
Where it does fall short, unfortunately, is the story. At times the childishness of the series really comes through and that will ruin it for some people. As well, some things just don't make much sense. 
 
But if you love furry little creatures, and love it even more when they're personified, then you really need to start watching Hamtaro / Tottoko Hamutaro.

          
 
       Helpful It's Hamtaro time! Ah Hamtaro, so many fond memories of replaying the first six episodes non-stop for 5 years straight. 
 
Hamtaro is a cute show about hamsters that gives me mad nostalgia! As I lived in the craze of hamsters from around 2010, I was like most other kids at the time, OBSESSED with these cute fuzzy creatures. 
Now I know that Hamsters have always been popular, but it seem searches boosted in February of 2010. 
 
Now, I loved hamtaro as a young kid, but how do they hold up today? 
 
Well, after revisiting it and watching the first 8 episodes, I think it is still an adorable little romp that kids and some adults may enjoy!.

19,6023,41,5.866893694,Anime with an ensemble casts,Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza,"Haruka's manga and anime hobby is still concealed by her dear friend Yuuto, but Yuuto's other female friend starts to feel affection and attraction towards him, so a feelings war begins among their circle of friends. Meanwhile Yuuto tries to make Haruka happy doing what she likes the most: drawing manga, watching anime, and attending special anime events. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Romance']","""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza"" is more-or-less a tease of an anime. You're left with a nice glimpse as to how ""Purezza"" will actually treat its viewers if you remember the ""rainbow-eel scene"" at the end of season one. We are the rabbits on the treadmill chasing the carrot on the stick - which in this case is their relationship.  
 
Knowing that there was a season two, I highly enjoyed the first season. Probably more than I should have - ignorant to the fact that I would be getting this same treatment for another 12 episodes. 
 
I held onto this audacious chance of being satisfied until the very end. But long before that, I had an inkling that season two would leave me wanting more without answering any questions (good marketing though, right?). Coinciding with my failing sense of hope with season two was that my pessimistic side was beginning to grow. I started to just get outright frustrated - more so than is normal in other animes. Basically, if the show was pointing towards this happening: I wanted the complete opposite of that. But believe me when I say I was justified.  
 
As the episodes progress, you get a feeling of ""how far the creators are willing to go with anything."" In the eyes' of the many, that isn't very far, unfortunately. And this is where the show begins to predominately fail. All the ""quasi-confessions"" (I... I... I want to be with you) are recycled in an endless repetition that they seem to blend together into one commitment-less ball. 
 
However, there's something about it I enjoyed enough for me to keep checking in very, very late every Monday to look for the new fan-subs. Although it was most likely hope, I would like to think it's something more. 
 
Every episode definitely has a ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza""-complex. Meaning that each had their own charm that's specific to each show, but seldom happens in anime. So, going by the ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza""-complex, even the episodes that were deemed of a larger importance seemed to fall short in the devotedness and ended up being good ""no Himitsu"" episodes, but none that were good as ""episodes"".  
 
Sometimes it's good to have a definitive close to things, where something is wrapped up nicely and given a good send-off. I guess the creators' didn't really understand that. If you want to be teased with no foreseeable closure, ""Purezza"" is the right anime for you. However, if you're normal and do not like to be screwed around with, you're not missing much if you saw season one, but elect not to pick up two. 
 
There is a little something we're left with in the end credits that basically says: ""Let's see each other again."" Whether that might mean an OVA or a season three, I have no idea. All that I can infer is that season 1 sold well, most likely meaning this season will probably sell well, too. Usually when you're making stuff people are buying, you keep making it, so I would not be surprised if there is something as lengthy as an entirely new season or just a few OVAs. Being that the creators' REALLY, REALLY left this one with A LOT of places yet to go, I would say it's 70% likely. Don't expect it for a year or so, though. 
 
""Purezza"" has an unexplainable charm that draws you back in when you want to let go. If you haven't yet decided to watch this, and are deciding between this and another anime, watch that other anime - you're not missing anything by leaving it at season one. However, if OVAs or a season three is announced, I would pick ""Purezza"" up. Because the writers have a sometimes annoying habit of bringing back key pieces of past episode[s] to grasp the present episode[s]. 
6/10.

       Helpful This absolutely entailing romance story will make you realize or remember what it means to be a man in adolescence to cope with your uneasy feelings to the one you love. This story wraps you around action, comedy, envy, erotic guilty pleasure in this world… of pure innocence.  
 
It continues where the story left off but it’s like Yuuto and Haruka never kissed at the end of the first season. The series gives you the exciting impression of a rival seriously coming into play. Shiina, however, never really does anything but just appear in one or two scenes every two episodes which taunts you at first but then the director really was trolling. She was the only one with a respectable personality that wasn’t completely flat. Instead, we are treated to a childish romance with no story at all. Yuuto and Haruka have the lowest human intelligence imaginable in that kind of relationship. “Blinded by love” is an understatement.  
 
The way they stall the plot is to be shy all the time, distractions of Haruka’s maids and her sister and random fanservice. The ecchi is sometimes badly timed to break the mood the director was working on.  
 
The parts with story are taken from other sources which leave it ridden with cliché for horrid after tastes. Zero originality.  
 
Yuuto is an enemy to most of the male audience for being too much of a wimp to do anything! If he does try to do something, he acts it out poorly and then gets backed up by maids… MAIDS!! The girls are more “manly” than his wasteful existence. Let me compare him to a rock and you know what I mean. A typical rock is sturdy for support in the world. It erodes to make soil and whatnot or is recycled into the mantle. Yuuto does little to nothing. The rock wins!  
 
Haruka is an overly innocent girl and dumb as shit. On a positive note, they are made for each other. It’s a shame the secondary characters are more developed since all they do is obstruct the “story”. Aside from Haruka’s father, ALL the male cast are failures.  
 
As you drag yourself along this already “fruitful” (but forgot to pick the fruit however it still ripens) series, you just don’t care anymore to see the inevitable, cheesy, obvious romantic conclusion with zero satisfaction guaranteed (unless your experience is low).  
 
Generic ecchi + poor romance story = below average score. Nuff said, nuff said.  


          
 
       Helpful This is my first time giving a review so bear with me. 
I was hesitating to watch this anime because of the MAL users score about this anime but I give it a try. This anime is not that bad as the other viewers says. The prequel is pretty good.To summarize Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza gives the supporting character a story and little development between the main characters. A kiss on cheek, a hug, holding hands and other fan service. I really enjoy this anime because it's light hearted story. maybe I'm getting tired of unusual stories. this anime is about normal people doing normal things (sometimes unusual but it's part of an anime). One thing i want to say, Give it a shot. Don't judge an anime if you haven't watch it.  
Overall I have fun watching this series.

Story 
Name is appropriate for film. Sadly there is no story told. Without much in background information we can only guess what the underline message is. My take was that when you are born using your parents attributes it is like a lottery to see how you will turnout. If you are lucky you could be a model in appearance. That would equal to winning the lottery. Although true as that statement may be provides a negative outlook on life for those that did not hit the 'jackpot'. Are we the non jackpot winners not worth life? That answer is sadly not answered by the abrupt ending.

       Helpful People always look too deep into things. Especially with anime. This whole thing started as a way to just make an animated self-portrait, Tezuka did a whole bunch of experimental things like this such as in his other film, Bouncing. that had no underlying purpose. If you want a big amazing story with lots of depth you won't get this here. Go read Apollo's Song or watch Metropolis or Black Jack or something. It doesn't outstay it's welcome, I couldn't imagine a big in-depth story being created from an animated self-portrait. Tezuka honestly just loved doing new stuff with animation, and this is a result of him wanting to do something for fun. Yes, he found animation fun, I think he saw it as creating life.

The song is also used as the opening theme for Devil Survivor 2 The Animation.","['Action', 'Supernatural', 'Music', 'Seinen']","Take Your Way is a pretty emotional music video. 
 
The MV tells the story of a boy who failed to save the one he loves, but is given another chance from a friend who offers his life in exchange. The song is told through the perspective of the one who sacrifices himself. The song's heartwarming lyrics about lifting the person one cares about to encourage them to try again, only this time they are not alone. kz's signature heartfelt lyrics and composing that tugs at one's heart-strings are all present and are enhanced by the narrative told through the visuals. 
 
The video plays with the nicely with the colors it assigns to its characters. The scene of the friend merging with the boy with the glasses and mixing their color coupled with the lyrics at that point about not being afraid and that he's never alone is handled wonderfully, followed by a great Itano circus with different colored missiles flying over the screen and leaving behind trails of onomatopoeia that was also done previously, but this time, resulting in a successful attempt at saving the girl and and a happy ending. 
 
Its empowering song about encouragement told from the perspective of a person who wanted nothing more than to see his friend succeed and the MV's distinct style of coloring and incorporating it in its narrative make Take Your Way a pretty great anime.

19,13029,44,5.820863075,Anime with an ensemble casts,Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi,"A new anime adaptation by Sparky Animation, Duckbill Entertainment, Baku Enterprise and Bandai Visual of the book Arashi no Yoru ni (One Stormy Night...) by Kimura Yuuichi.","['Adventure', 'Drama']","I still start by saying that it is impossible for me to give a completely unbiased review of this series, given my efforts in the English dub of the original movie that preceded the series. 
 
""Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi"" is another realisation of the story based on the original series of childrens books written over fifteen years ago now.  The story is basic enough: A goat and a wolf befriend each other whilst taking shelter from a storm, and due to the dark environment and lack of ability to smell each other, they resort to having a conversation that sees them discover they have a lot in common.  They only discover their differences in species when they meet again the following day, but the choose to pursue their friendship rather than let base instinct get the better of them. 
 
Where the series differs from the books and the movie is that Mei, who was originally cast as male in the movie and always seen as male by the author of the books, has now become May, a female goat.  This was probably done for marketing purposes to appeal to a larger audience, as well as to quash the more homoerotic undertones that the original story suffered from (through no fault of the story or movie itself, morseco thanks to the attention it received from people who wished to see such in the story, most notably in the furry fandom.)  I find this a disappointing change, as it actually leaves the interpretation of May and Gabu's relationship as being more a romance than a friendship, particularly in the way some episodes depict interaction between the two. 
 
The visuals are bright, cheery, and appealing to younger audiences; all the characters have a very neotenic style, especially the goats, though even Ghiro looks quite tame compared to his movie counterpart.  The backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the animation at times can be stilted, the goats' anatomy lookng downright weird at times. 
 
The series is also clearly aimed at a much younger audience, with the English dialogue very slow and simplified, likely to assist with youngsters wishing to learn English.  Whilst the voices are acceptable, it lacks the flow and greater expression of the Japanese dub, even though the animation is tailored to synchronise with the English dub.  The soundtrack also re-uses substantial amounts of the orchestral soundtrack written for the original movie, with other incidental music sounding much cheaper for the rest of the time. 
 
The series, running at 26 episodes, only covers the original story up to about book 4 of the original 7-book series, and re-writes certain scenes from both the books and the movies, using elements of the later books but in reference to other characters.  Why this was done is unclear, as the current series has an extremely open ending and feel incomplete as it stands, with no resolution to the actions of certain characters.  Whether or not this indicates there will be a second season of the show is unknown, but as it stands the conclusion to the series is quite unsatisfying in its attempt to wrap things up. 
 
Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10.  It has its heartwarming moments, and the story is still touching, but it is lacking in a great many ways compared to the original story books and movie adaptation.

Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.

Gainax will also be hosting four events to celebrate this occasion at this year's Tokyo International Anime Fair, featuring voice actors from the anime.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha']","Don't get me wrong here. 
 
I fucking LOOOOVE Gurren Lagann! For the past 8 months, it's been my all-time favorite anime. Everything about TTGL is brilliant including the plot, characters, music, and art, which Gainax had done an excellent job of making sure all of these factors were amazing. However, beyond that, I love the themes about evolution and ambition, two values which hold up very high to me. This show inspired and uplifted me, made me think about my life in a different way and made me realize the goals and dreams I had deep within me, that's how powerful this show was to me! But, let's not beat around the bush, this is going to be a review on the first movie, NOT on the excellent anime. 
 
This movie is much like a recap movie of the first 15 episodes of the main series. But, it's not a recap movie like e.g the first two Madoka Magica movies. No, the Gurren Lagann movies include new footage and information that wasn't spread out in the main show. I'm going to try to spoil as little as I can, but an example in this movie was that they explored Lorgenomes backstory and how the world of Gurren Lagann came to be. There are many other things like that which get explained here. I think this is a great thing to do because even as amazing as TTGL was, there were still some questions left unanswered that left some wide gaps. 
 
The purpose of these two movies was I think to fill in those gaps like f.ex who was Lordgenome or how the world of TTGL was made while also recapping the most essential parts of the story, which I think these two movies succeeded excellently at.  There were quite an alarming amount of things that I hadn't noticed or forgot about in the main series e.g how Yoko came from an underground village with Dayakka, that the whole show was post-apocalyptic or that Dai-Gurren ship was originally enemy property which the gang had invaded. 
 
However, with all that being said, there's not much else to take home. What I disliked about this movie in particular in how rushed it felt. It felt like Gainax knew they couldn't pack in 16 episodes worth of material in a duration of just two small hours, but tried to anyways. It's not as though they only included the most essential moments and the new stuff. No, they also diverged from the main series for the reason to alter the story, which felt totally unnecessary. This was most clear towards the end, where they try to defeat the gunmen. 
 
To conclude, this movie succeeded in adding new and interesting stuff but failed in trying to bring its own thing, instead of just being obedient and faithful to its original source. The result was a mediocre movie which I won't revisit any time soon. But, wait! Don't watch this before the main series please! Watch these two movies AFTER the main 28 episode series, then watch these two moves. I would also recommend giving a lot of time between watching the series and the movies because then it will be easier to contrast and compare the two. Speaking of two, I will now go on to review the other movie!

Some obvious advices/facts before we dive into the review. 
 
1.	 
This is NOT a standalone movie thus having knowledge from the TV series is highly recommended and also beneficial to your mind. 
2. 
Do NOT compare the pacing of the TV series with the movie. One is called a TV series and the other is called a movie for a reason, k? Both the TV series and the movie are by the original director and script editor so they know what they are messing with. 
3.	 
Do NOT expect to see a lot of new footages. Does this mean this is a “recap” of the TV series? Not exactly. There are enough plot differences in the battles for this movie to be considered an adaptation instead of a complete “recap”.  
4.	 
Is the movie rushed? To a large extent, yes it is. There is simply too much material to cover in too little time. This is probably what most people are complaining about. 
5.	 
Is it worth your time to watch this? Only if you can distinguish what to expect between a TV series and a movie. 
 
The problem with trying to remake a masterpiece level of work (and that applies not only to anime) is that people will only be curious to see how the new work can surpass the previous work. Often people will have a pre-set level of expectation for these works and more often people will find themselves expecting too much and ended in disappointment. For example, after rating the original TV series 10/10, viewer X eagerly awaits the movie adaptation. But what can he really expect? That the movie worth 11/10? No, that is not possible. This is all thanks to something called human prejudice. Everyone who has seen the TV series first will consciously/unconsciously be comparing them. So please be mindful when watching the movie not to compare it bit by bit with the TV series. It is not fair for the movie. 
 
Those of us who have seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) will know what it means when I say the show as a whole defies the Laws of Physics. While there are plenty of examples for that type of shows, TTGL is by far the most outrageous, thus the term “epicness” is seen wherever TTGL appears. The story of TTGL is a prime example of the “underdog” battle. The main characters began with very little fighting chance but every time they seem to turn the impossible possible. And how do they do that? With a DRILL of course! 
 
The movie has some great new battle scenes. Animation wise it is the same as the TV series (for those who like to compare the two). Most scenes were pretty consistent but lacking in details from time to time which is to be expected from the sketchy and cartoonish-looking animation. What truly makes TTGL “epic” though is that the scenes match well with the “mood” at that particular moment of the show. This is partially due to the great soundtracks and theme songs by Shoko Nakagawa. Overall those of us who are familiar with Gainax’s previous works will not be disappointed in TTGL.  
 
Character wise, there was a slightly heavier emphasis on Yoko in this movie which is great for all Yoko lovers. Simon and Nia also have a decent character development throughout the movie. Unfortunately, because of time constrain, there was not much character building for the secondary characters like Rossiu and Kittan who ended up being quite hollow. Thus if all you ever care about is Kamina, Nia, Simon, and Yoko, then there shouldn’t be anything wrong for you. For the rest of us … brace ourselves for some disappointment here. 
 
The following is targeted to those who have concerns with regard to the pacing of the movie. Ask yourself this, how long as it been from the end of the TV series to the airing of the movie. Answer: 11 month and 1 week (give or take a few days). Do you honestly expect to see tremendous differences (next to what it has presented already) given the time? Do you honestly expect to see a whole new story with the same awesomeness produced in 51 weeks? Given the time, though of course we can argue that they could have delayed the movie if things didn’t work out, I think it was a fairly decent job. Hopefully you will find it a good enjoyable watch too!

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so here what you should NOT do right before watching this: watch the series. The entire movie is just splicing of direct cuts from the series, to make it shorter. Now if you have not seen the series at all, or have not seen it in a while, then this movie, and its sequel could be enjoyable.  
 
I really enjoy the series, and feel that anyone considering watching this should instead watch the series.

Her valiant efforts are recognized by her coworkers and little by little with their helpful aid they finish the job on time. 
 
Artwork is outstanding! sure i could say it underrated but having seen this show makes me realize what the anime could have been if there 'was no direction'. 
 
Characters are matched perfectly with their emotions. Whether it is anger or confusion.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Before falling into relative obscurity, 2001’s OVA Animation Runner Kuromi was the definition of “anime about making anime”. In a not completely unexplored field, with other renditions made by even the tenth episode of Paranoia Agent (Satoshi Kon, 2004) the indisputable champion in this area is nowadays Shirobako (PA Works, 2014), with also the advantage of covering this topic for two whole cours.  
 
Nonetheless, as opposed to the almost methodical approach Shirobako follows throughout its run, Animation Runner Kuromi’s is much more comedy-centered. And not only because it doesn’t have much time to waste (much like the animators doing their job there) but because the whirlwind of a pace it follows constitutes the very core of its style.  
 
And to understand the comedy we need to have a glance at the Staff that created it. This OVA was directed by Akitarou Daichi, a pretty prolific worker of the industry that had his name in numerous series from the 90s and 00s, from whom we can highlight the likes of Kodomo no Omocha, Fruits Basket, Now and Then, Here and There, Nurse Angel Ririka or Bokura ga Ita. Also important to note the work of Hajime Watanabe, character designer for some of the aforementioned as well as other well-known shows such as Kaleido Star and School Rumble.  
 
Out of all those, Kuromi has a look and feel that resembles Kodomo no Omocha to a breathtaking extent. Definitely the hectic rhythm and unique slapstick work wonders with the new subject matter we are presented with. 
Ultimately, there’s an important moral to be learned here. Coordinating projects is not an easy task, no matter the type of activity in which you’re working. Both Shirobako and Kuromi depict problems in production, yet the former prioritizes a positive message built around the profession, almost like a love letter towards animation. The latter's message is even more fundamental, aiming for human understanding, hard-work and empathy.  
 
Every anime watcher needs to experience either of these to get to the bottom of production and unravel the actual human work that any project constitutes, how rarely anime is made solely by the efforts of one studio but by an extensive net of connections that goes well beyond what we first imagine.  
 
In this regard there are also documentaries and articles covering the different challenges of artistic creation within the industry. An example could be the one showing the crafting of Only Yesterday, with a highlight being how an animator spent an entire year drawing anything but safflowers. The truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, so one might be better off getting their first exposure to the whole picture by this hilarious, yet definitely introspective treat.  


          
 
       Helpful Animation Runner Kuromi is cute, fun, and pretty hilarious too! The story begins when Kuromi starts her first day at work. Unfortunately for her, after her production manager faints from being overworked, she's forced to take his job and become the next production manager. This might not have been that bad if the animators weren't so lazy that they couldn't even be bothered to work at the studio most of the time. With a fast approaching deadline and barely any of the show animated, can Kuromi get it done in time?!? 
 
  The story itself is pretty basic. What really makes it shine are the jokes and references (look out for Lupin III *cough cough* I mean Luis Monde III) along with it's unique setting. Be careful, because you might actually learn a thing or two about the animation industry! 
 
  The art is very cute and chibi-esque. This often adds to the shows comedy via exaggerated movement. It's not particularly unique in any way besides being chibi, but all of the characters have interesting designs and don't all look the same. 
 
  The characters all have different personalities, and part of the story is about Kuromi trying to understand each one of them so that she can get the animators to do their jobs. The only characters who undergo any development are Kuromi and Hamako, but considering this is a 40 minute ova there doesn't really need to be much. 
 
  I watched the dub, which seemed to be pretty well done. The music never stands out, but it does it's job. Sound effects are pretty good too. 
 
  So basically, you really don't have a reason not to watch this. It's only 40 minutes long and extremely easy to find (wink wink, nudge nudge youtube.) Check it out if you get the chance!

-There are only six episodes 
 
These specials do exactly what they set out to do. Each episode is just a compilation of fanservice shots of one of the girls. This is generally what's done with blu-ray specials for ecchi shows like this. If you watched this show purely for the fanservice—or if you just want more than what the show gave—these are worth a watch or two or more because they bring even more sexuality into an already sexualized cast.

It is comprised of 12 short stories (5 minutes long each) that only build up a small amount of plot for each story. The anime feeds off the stupidest things, but is quite humorous.

I could honestly write a review about garlic chicken spring rolls here, and it would be about as thorough as any review about this anime. Thats how nothing this anime is. And I enjoyed every minute of it. The episodes are like all really short so you can blast through the series in like an hour, but thats not the point here. The point here is just to relish in the absolute nothing that it is and take each episode like the individual journey of pointless that it is. Also theres a bear thats a pervert that enjoys stealing girls swimsuits. 9/10. 

          
 
       Helpful Gyagu Manga Biyori is a collection of off the wall short clips that manage to present some of the strangest and most hilarious stories ever conceived within a five minute running time--hell, sometimes they even manage to fit two plots into one episode. This length attempts to ensure that things remain frantic, fast-paced and fun, which Gyagu Manga Biyori is for the most part. This series has a critical flaw however: for every gut-buster of an episode, there exists a five minute dud to act as a counterweight, leading to a very uneven watching experience as a whole. 
 
Despite its mixed results, Gyagu Manga Biyori deserves plenty of praise for its bold and absurd brand of humor. This series does its share of parodies and relies on some comic standbys, but beyond that, GMB presents situations that are indescribably ridiculous--things that shouldn\'t even be funny, but are for some unknown reason. It is difficult to describe such a rarely-experienced combination of amusement and confusion in simple text (and without spoiling anything), which means that the reader must watch the show to truly appreciate these words. But as stated earlier, when GMB does not have the viewer gasping for air, it will have him or her nodding off. It is amazing how long five minutes can seem when the show tries to be funny and fails. 
 
Nevertheless, Gyagu Manga Biyori is a strong overall effort. The simple character designs, exaggerated voice acting, disturbing opening and ending sequences, and memorable characters are sure to brighten the viewer up. Most importantly, the episodic nature of the series makes it ideal for a quick laugh with no strings attached. Fans of gags and general strangeness are sure to enjoy this.

          
 
       Helpful Gagyu Manga Biyori is one of those comedy sketch shows based on the manga of the same name. Set out in short five minute episodes they set out to try to make u laugh by showing you crude drawings silly parodies and anything else in between. Being a super short anime the comedy hits you fast and hard. You'll either get it or you dont. And its painstakingly obvious that they care more about the punchline over the artwork. But then would you care of what you drew if it was a short 5 minute skit of nothing but japanese slapstick? 
 
The art work looks like it was done by an elementary student its so crude. The art is so bad its a comedy in itself. But it does get the point across. Theres nothing much else to say about the art here. Well if there was something that was good about the art was that each skit series had its own art style, to an extent. 
 
Characters are nothing but average joe characters there to be made fun of. Each one has their own special silliness about them. But if you dont really understand japanese humor then you'll most likely miss the punchline to most of these characters jokes. They talk fast and so you'll have to understand them fast. But if you do understand you'll be treated to hilarity. 
 
The sound is almost as appalling as the animation. No music very little sound effects, and so that leaves it all up to the voice actors. They do get many of the jokes across, but their performance isn't anything outstanding. They wont win any awards here :) 
 
All in all for what its worth its comedy served in small bites. If u want a quick laugh then go for it. But if youre expecting this to be like any other anime variety show, be forewarned its nothing you normally see.

I've played Ragnarok Online for several years now 4+ 
I've read the 10 Ragnarok manga chapters.  
 
 
This game is just an adaptation of the Ragnarok Online game... every information like the locations, monsters, items, graphics, classes is part of the game. 
The story and the characters are original from the anime.  
 
 
I am considering 7 as average.  
 
Story - 7  
Story of those people going in an adventurous journey for the sake of justice and then answering their questions, ok.  However the journey itself becomes very lame. They just go around the world (not that much distance is covered hmmm maybe region? I want to say the map of the game), and encounter different lame enemies... they just give me this lame feeling.   
Each episode, they encounter a different scene... it gets boring making the whole thing boring. 
There was however 1 past fact, flashback that was somehow interesting. 
 
Art - 6 
Everything was like taken from the game so I do not see what art it has. It's real art is... adapting a MMORPG into an anime, I'll give it that, but I wish they had done it better... much better. 
 
Sound - 6-7 
Other than a possibly good OP, and an ok ED, there was no music that attracted me.  
The sound effects were normal, ok. 
NO, I lied. I was not particularly paying attention at the sound, and it was 1 year ago. I think it was just normal, anyways  6-7  
 
Characters - 6 
 
Each character has some classic characteristics, and they stick very tightly to those classic attributes.  Somehow adapting to their classes. 
All classic characters = fail 
They never walk out from their classic attributes.  
Character development? the very normal one.  
 
Enjoyment - 7 
 
The fighting scenes using magics and swords was ok.... 
Was nice to see some skills from the game being animated in an anime. 
Enjoyed that the story was finally over, and their enjoyment of having achieved something big... although it was like  normal people SOMEHOW achieving something extraordinary.

The anime would have been good for a childhood anime. Good anime for 10- year old childs, it really gave me that feeling. The ideas being resolved were at that level.  
 


          
 
       Helpful This review is mainly aimed at those who have played the game Ragnarok Online, and are tempted to watch this anime as an additional bonus. All I can say... It was an extremely disappointing and generic fanservice based fantasy show. 
 
You would think that with the game, there would be countless of possabilities in making the anime good based on the potential surrondings. But instead we get given two extremely annoying characters that don't seem to have a clue about what they're doing and where they are going. The romance in this is extremely forced, in fact, it was more focused on perversing on the female characters than developing the romance. 
 
For those who believe there can be no real decent story adaptation from a game. The reason I claim this is wrong, is due to the countless amount of fanfiction and fan-comics that have developed over the years on the internet. Most of them have better plot lines than the one presented in this. 
 
Save your time if you are wanting to watch a decent anime. Otherwise, watch it if you're curious about how bad, or how unfairly I've rated it.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School']","If you enjoy catching references to other anime within anime, this show has got you more than covered. If you don't really care about doing that, this show really doesn't give much of anything to you, except some funny scenes and random fanservice. 
 
Obviously, it's written for people who are already anime otaku, about a group of anime otaku. At first, I thought it was kind of fun, and the characters were relatable and somewhat entertaining. But the farther I watched, the more ridiculous they got, showing the more extreme kinds of otaku; sort of the kind of people you would not want to actually talk to because they don't know how to talk about anything except anime. 
 
The story is a basic club anime plot, with some scenes thrown in (people's reaction to their cultural festival event) that were unrealistic enough that it just annoyed me. The characters are entertaining, but their personalities are incredibly one-dimensional and don't progress or grow at all. Everything that happens is predictable enough that there's absolutely 0 suspense factor, even suspense that do /know/ what's going to happen. Most club anime, you know things will work out, but it's written in a way that you think, maybe, things really might not work out, which makes them more entertaining to watch. Anime-gataris does not do that. You know exactly what's going to happen at any given time in the show. The one thing I was interested in finding out more about even turned out to be nothing even remotely interesting, nor did it really make any sense at all. 
 
The soundtrack is OK. It's certainly not bad, and I like the ED song, but it's not the kind of stuff I'd go look up on youtube to listen to after the show ends. About the same goes for the animation, though that's lower quality than the sound is.  
 
I assume they didn't have the biggest budget/time allotment for episodes of this. The character art is a bit inconsistent, but faaar from the worst I've seen. What really bothers me more than inconsistency and static-ness is the lip sync. Yes, most anime will have a lot of ""lip syncing"" that's just the mouth opening and closing as if the person's saying ""ah ah ah ah"" the whole time. But most anime don't put focus on the mouths as if the sync animation is amazing when they do that. The whole ED video focuses on lip syncing, even though they didn't make the syncing look decent. There's also a, like, 30 second or so fanservice clip where you see nothing but the girl's mouth moving but it's just doing that Ah Ah Ah Ah thing. I wouldn't mind it if they didn't try to make it seem like it was good animation even though it isn't, but boy, they sure do. 
 
Overall, my feelings towards this show are just that it's decent. Fun to watch if you're bored, but don't expect anything more than that. There's a chance you might get attached to like, one character, like myself and some other people I know did, but really none of them are actually interesting, just cute at times. Which is about how the whole series is.

          
 
       Helpful Animegataris is time capsule anime of our generation similar to that of genshiken or the even older otaku no video. 
 
What do I mean by a Time capsule anime? 
 
Basically it is an anime that reference a multitude of other anime while making fun of meta elements of the anime fandom/production. 
 
 
An anime about anime and otakus, for otakus.  
 
It is something akin to a recap of everything we have come to love or hate over the past years, reflecting the anime fandom's many cultures. 
 
On the basis of what this anime is supposed to be, they may have earned a very high 8/10 to a 9/10 as they managed to cover all of the many known shows as well as major otaku events and an amazing amount of meta knowledge. 
 
As a standalone anime, it earns a 8/10 
 
It had a lot of twists and turns that only an anime with a lot of references to others and the anime industry itself can make, making it very unique and fresh. Even though there are some parts that may have fallen flat, it was still something that you can take your time with and enjoy. It has enough rules and story elements that makes it work. But there are still unsolved mysteries and loose ends that i'd really want them to tie up, maybe an OVA. 
 
Art: 10/10 
 
Why 10/10? The reason for that is neither because it's beautifully drawn nor animated, but because of all the different styles that they were able to cram into this one anime without overwhelming the watchers and making it a spectacle. You get 3DCG, flash tier drawing, super stylized drawing, 80-90s anime style drawing. There is so many of these things that you can pick up on and the amount of time and effort that went into making these twists made it a 10/10. 
 
sound: 8/10 
 
The opening and ending, good god it's amazingly catchy and fun. The osts were very noticeable and were very fitting to the scene. While it's not a fancy 10/10 it gets the points across as is able to emphasize a scene very well. The feeling of tension, happiness, dread were all able to be conveyed across very well with different osts found in the anime. 
 
Characters: 10/10 
 
The characters are distinctive and shows improvement over time as we slowly see. First they started off with only one feature, then slowly expanded over time. Specifically minoa and her character development, fun is an understatement of watching a total anime noob grow into a full blown otaku, she feels ALIVE and absorbing, and remind us anime watchers of what it FEELS like when we were getting into the fandom as well.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I have watched a lot of anime, I have seen many hidden gems and many mainstream ones, this anime had reference to all of the them and being able to decipher and pick up these different references made it extremely enjoyable to watch.  
And then we had the meta jokes, good lord, find me something else to use other than fun and enjoyable because those are enough to portray how i feel when watching this anime.  
The twists were somewhat surprising kept us looking forward to more.  
 
It's a total blast to watch this anime. 
 
Overall 9/10: 
 
My honest opinion is that, if you've ever watched anime in your life and find yourself wanting to watch more and learn more about the fandom via anime, or if you're a hardcore fan with a lot of anime under your belt. You absolutely need to watch this anime, you will gain insight on many things that you may have never seen before, and if you want you will gain the joy of being to pick these things up. It is a blast to watch and a roller coaster of a ride. I wholesomely believe that this anime will most likely serve as an initiator of sorts to the uninitiated and something future watchers will be using as reference when researching about anime. It has a lot of value as a Time capsule anime. And they sure used the genre they are in very well, as  in if this anime isn't a Time capsule anime, we might not see this level of brilliance. Kudos to those that planned and made this anime, it was truly an amazing gem. Solid 9/10.

          
 
       Helpful Story: An anime that basically spoofs on other anime. While it had it's light hearted moments it had it's serious and angry moments as well.

I have to give a lot of credit to the writers for an original script.

Sound: The opening was very fun and catchy. DJ Neko Sensei is awesome! The ending was cute and played well with the Idol comparison. The bgm during the show was really well done. With multiple situations I felt like it would be all over the place, but the music was very well done. 
 
Character: While each character fit there description to a T (Rich Girl, Glasses Snob etc) i felt like they really were in a league of their own. Yeah that had generic aspects about them but I felt like they went above and beyond in their character class. basically I liked all of their roles and how they played them. 
 
Enjoyment: This was a really fun anime to watch. Honestly I got more laughs and enjoyment out of this anime then most others. 
 
Overall: I would highly recommend Animegataris if your looking for a spoof anime with a lot of laughs and good moments. While not a Masterpiece I feel like it's definitely Shelf Worthy.

19,2286,53,5.569353093,Anime with an ensemble casts,Little Nemo,"Based on the classic Nemo comic strips by Winsor McCay. A pioneer of animation, McCay created the first Little Nemo animated movie in 1911. 
 
Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were attached to this project at first, but left due to ""creative differences."" Ray Bradbury is also thought to have left the project in its earlier stages. 
 
Little Nemo - Adventures in Slumberland is the first Japanese anime to receive a national (wide) U.S. theatrical release. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']","Overview: 
 
Time to look at a genre that I have completely neglected in my previous reviews. The world of anime children's movies! What better place to start then with Little Nemo, the first anime movie ever to see widespread theatrical release in the United States? This was 1992, so I was only 4 when this came out in theaters and it...was an experience. I remember that much from my first viewing, but I didn't re-watch this film until recently. 
 
Background: 
 
Although released stateside in 1992, Little Nemo was actually made in 1989. I mention this because it was an odd period for kids movies. This was the 1980s, right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid's movies. The 1980s was a time when nearly ALL the kids movies tried to be dark, daring, and really push the envelope. Sometimes this resulted in masterpieces like  The Neverending Story from West Germany, Miyazaki's Nausicca, and America's Secret of Nimh. Other times this attempt to be ""dark and edgy""  led to nothing but batshit insanity with nightmare fuel imagery for no reason, exemplified by films like The Brave Little Toaster. Little Nemo...is much more Toaster than Nausicca. 
 
Plot: 5/10 
 
The plot is very loosely based on a 1905 American comic about a boy that falls asleep and has adventures in dreamland. He must help Morpheus the king of dreamland defeat the evil king of the nightmare world. At least the fact that he IS dreaming explains the very surrealist imagery, along with all the scenes young children would find disturbing. He is in the nightmare world after all, unlike Toaster where twisted, freaky shit just happens at complete random! In the end, Nemo defeats the Nightmare King, realizes it was all a dream (the cliche' award goes to...) and goes to the circus with his family. There really isn't much to say about the plot because Nemo is a purely visual experience. Unlike the 3 masterpiece children's films I mentioned above, Nemo doesn't really tackle complex issues or themes. It doesn't have a deep message with layers of symbolism for adults to enjoy like Nausicca or Neverending Story. It is an interesting little visual experience, but not really much else.  
 
Characters: 3/10 
 
The characters in this movie are honestly really bland. Nemo himself is a very 2D character and the most memorable character is an obnoxious clown played by Japan's favorite comedian Mickey Roony! At least he isn't dressed up in ""yellow face"" in this movie. Instead the clown is drawn with what looks suspiciously like ""black face"" because that's...better? 
 
Sound: 5/10 
 
It has a kind of catchy opening theme, but it is VERY misleading since it is so cheerful and light, yet this movie is mostly not. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
Little Nemo was a box office disaster losing over 30 million dollars, which was a big deal in 1992. The film was critically panned by Roger Ebert, and most of the other elite American film critics of that time. Honestly, I don't blame them. The art and animation was good at times, but that is really the only thing positive I have to say about this movie. I have met a few other people my age that actually liked this POS, but then again my generation liked Space Jam. Overall, I wouldn't really bother seeing Little Nemo unless you are very interested in anime history or just morbidly curious.

          
 
       Helpful What an odd little movie. So bad, and yet such a colorful history.  
 
You may notice I generally gave some poor scores, but highly recommend this movie. Why? It's a perfect example of why communication is important. This movie has everything it needs to be amazing. It was worked on by some true animation giants. Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame, who invented many standards of animation that are used to this day. Ray Bradbury, writer of Fahrenheit 451. Music by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote a ton of music I guarantee you know! Even Hayao Miyazaki, the man the myth the legend, worked on the film for a brief time. If you look closely you can see their influences. And there are some other big names linked to this project. 
 
So why do so many rights make a ginormous wrong?  
 
Lack of communication.  
 
Some are quoted as saying they asked the animators what they were working off of, ""we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing"" and when Bradbury was asked what he doing he said ""I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing"" 
 
Insert screaming melty man pop art. I highly recommend you watch this movie simply because it is such a piece of animation history with so many big names on it. You can see Chuck Jones' influence in the design of the squirrel Icarus. And some scenes, like them fancifully bouncing around the kingdom on balls while a song plays, are clearly worked on by Miyazaki. It's fun to watch and try to spot who animated what. 
 
This is definitely a film to watch when you're in the mood for a bad movie.

          
 
       Helpful ""Little Nemo"" is one of those movies where the backstory on it's creation is more famous (and probably more entertaining) than the movie itself. With such a tumultuous creative process from beginning to finished product, this film often gets a reputation for being such a train wreck. After watching it, I think it's not quite the demon from development Hell most make it out to be. 
 
To start with the animation itself, it's actually pretty darn good for the late 1980s. It's smooth, colorful, with some neat characters (special mention to the absolutely terrifying Nightmare King). It resembles a Disney film in a lot of ways with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special. Kid goes on a magical journey through a fantasy world where he overcomes his fears to save the day and learns many valuable lessons. Blah, blah, blah...  
 
I have only seen the English version of this whose cast features a few names you might recognize. Veteran child actor (kind of an oxymoron, I know) Gabriel Damon in the lead as Nemo, plus the legendary Mickey Rooney, and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: DS9"" fame. Decent job by everyone overall, but playing characters that are mediocre at best. 
 
This is a kids movie, pure and simple. And from that genre and target audience the film does pretty well. But, when you read the backstory (and I encourage you to) and watch it you start to catch glimpses here and there of what could have been rather than what it is. What it is is a halfway decent kids movie. What could it have been...? Well, the answer to that question is something we can only dream about. Fitting I suppose for this movie. Cheers!

19,32829,54,5.563495341,Anime with an ensemble casts,Nobunaga no Shinobi,"Rescued from nearly drowning in a river, a young Chidori yearns to pay back her savior's kindness. Though her cute and innocent appearance might not show it, she is actually a highly skilled ninja, so years later, Chidori and her friend Sukezou come to serve under the man who saved her—the ambitious warlord, Nobunaga Oda. 
 
As Nobunaga fights off invading forces and sets his sights upon neighboring lands, Chidori is assigned vital tasks to assure victory, such as gathering information or assassinating key figures. Between taking on these important missions and dealing with the colorful cast of Nobunaga's family and servants, the young ninja is always ready to do her best to lead her master toward greatness. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Historical']","Nobunaga no Shinobi tells about the exploits of a shinobi called Chidori who works for Oda Nobunaga, a prominent (or rather, the most popular) warlord in Sengoku era (16th century). Basically it revolves around the things Chidori do as summoned by her lord. 
 
The episodes are short yet sweet. Characters are in chibi style and as such, it is comedic in nature and viewers should not expect serious historical accuracy in the series. However, those who appreciate Sengoku era history will probably enjoy this series better because they are familiar with the names and the character traits. 
 
The humor is lighthearted and it's rather manzai styled in my opinion, which I enjoy very much. The plot moves fast due to the length, but it doesn't deter the comprehension of the story at all and there is no time to get bored. 
 
Overall I give it a solid 9. Definitely recommended for casual anime watching to relax. 
 
P.S.: I absolutely love the opening song!

          
 
       Helpful Started off pretty slow and had a lot of fictional ass-pull to get the story kick started. Towards the end, it actually became more historical (Sengoku era), enough to actually get me to try to verify some of it. 
 
I expecting to learn something about Nobunaga and shinobi. Instead, I found a show that followed a ridiculously OP ""ninja"" who tried to be cute. I decided to watch the 2nd season hoping they'd show the invasion of the Iga territory... 
 
Regarding the story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, etc. I may have confused Nobunaga for being a ventriloquist. It was refreshing to see anyone who wasn't a samurai, but none really had any human-like depth to them. I've seen scripted NPCs more lively and animated. Don't think there was any real sound besides the voice acting and the OP. I think I most enjoyed seeing the overpowered ninja actually take some damage. 
 
Overall, I'd say don't bother. You can get your does of cuteness watching something else, and can learn more about Sengoku era in the dozens of other stuff produced.

          
 
       Helpful This is a simple comedy anime with some historical facts based on the warlord Oda Nobunaga with some obviously historical inaccuracy throughout it as it's clearly made for young children to watch and enjoy.  
 
Since this a comedy show the animation style is done with chibi style for all the characters, its simple and while I am not a particular fan of it, its fine for the run time of the anime being only three minutes long. And it works well for the show for the characters show off their more comedic expressions or tell the fast paced jokes in each of the episodes, but it still has problem. Some of the jokes can be hit or miss in some episodes and some jokes are often being told so fast often you might miss it. 
 
The music is repetitive and uninteresting and outside of the two opening songs, I just tried my best put up with the music in the background. The acting is fine, for the material that the actors have and I have nothing honestly bad to say about the characters or the story. Since I don't have any knowledge about these actual historical characters it was interesting to at least know abridged version of Nobunaga and his generals on the unification of Japan, but I understand if your familiar with the actual history of this era you probably be more upset with this anime than. 
 
It's an anime meant for a younger demographic, I know that but as an anime I just find it to be average, its fine if you take your time and watch and few episodes a day and not binge watch all the episodes at once, because you'll probably be more frustrated with it. If you don't care about the historical accuracy of the characters and take your time watching this series, you'll find an enjoyable, short and funny anime to pass the time with.

I will do my best effort to be not biased, but do take this review with a grain of salt. 
 
Story: 
The story is pretty simple.  Our hero gets possessed by an alien who calls himself Ultraman and he goes around and beats up Kaiju that threaten Earth.  The story does have progression despite how it might seem at first.  I cannot say much because spoilers, but the ending is pretty spectacular. However, getting there can take lots of patience.  You won't miss much if you skip most of the ordinary kaiju fights. 
 
Art: 
This series was made in 1980 so don't expect the clean artwork you see today.  Perspective can become pretty jarring and some things aren't particularly well fleshed out.  Fight scenes are lacking compared to today's standards.   
 
Sound: 
The opening and ending is amazing (bias).  But they are without a doubt, pretty catchy.  The sounds effects are pretty crude and old, but its pretty good if you can get past that.  
 
Character: 
Honestly, characters are pretty two dimensional.  There isn't much character development, but the show really likes to bait people into the typical ""He's gonna finally reveal his identity!"" card.  Pig the robot is pretty charming despite looking nothing like a pig nor is he visually appealing.  Marume becomes less of a jerk.  Other than that none of the humans particularly grow.   
 
Final Thoughts: 
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is fed up with Power Rangers or anyone who don't like Godzilla like stuff.

       Helpful Okay I will start with a spoiler tag do nt read this review because it will contain massive spoilers. read at your own peril.  But honestly if you're looking at this page and you haven't seen the six full seasons of Major yet you're either way too curious or don't mind spoilers but as they say curiosity will gt you killed. But enough with the lame jokes lets get down to the rant.  This will contain a full she's worth of frustration not by the ending but the steps to get there.  Ive wanted Toshi and Goro on the same team since like the first season and I k ow even thu the time skip happened at tend of the sixth season in all honesty I'm really more upset with he composition of the sixth season and how the time skip was used as a means to show a story that was too cookie cutter for my taste because it's not what Goro was ever about in the first place.  I know how the story was progressi but the sixth season had way too much filler and bullshit Goro being a lose, I don't mind him losing but watching the show became painful to watch and I appreciate the rounded character development but if you're going to go that far how do you go to a time skip that cuts out what this show has made its living on: the work to get there. You it's great he wins with Toshi and strikes it junior hurray but it never really feels like a completesd victory because I never felt the struggles to et there they've set this massive stage and just because they have to bring Toshi they put him there it makes me think that Goro could never really do anything on his own I know he's only. Rookie but they made it seem like the team that had pulled together couldn't do hit and only could do it when they needed it for a plot ending I want to know how many times they were in the world series I want to see mayamura struggle for an episode I mean actually struggle mind you.  Also it felt like the build up of Goro should've taken a better direction at the end because I could see the ending of the anime in my mind about when the third season heated up that he would go down like that but it always felt like he was on the path someone set for him he was always following people even in the next ova message I understand what they did with the ending but Goro was the same person his father was but better.  Are you kidding me, if you're gonna give me a half baked ending like this I'd rather you show off him making the Majors but they had to raise the bar for him only to have him pitch for the Blue oceans in Japan.  Even though it was well done it just doesn't sit rgiht with me the way this show ended. I want to give this show an 8 but I can't bring myself to because of the rushed ending that ending was really nothing more than fan servic and to me an ending that feels like a filler episode is worth watching but this show fell out of my top 5 anime. Sorry guys of you don't agree but I can only give it a 5. Up to season 5.3 was a masterpiece but that rushed ending to this conclusion.  The only thing I give a pass on is the romance in the time skip only because Goros so dense that trying to fill that in would take a new show let alone a season. 

          
 
       Helpful I've always been a baseball fan and an anime fan but Major was what got me started on baseball anime which is a genre I really enjoy. I loved Major and its one of my favorite animes mainly because of the characters and the exciting and at times very dramatic and touching story. World Series is the perfect ending to a great anime, wrapping everything up in the best way possible. There is nothing more in the story to be explored, and nothing more for major to accomplish. this ends it so satisfyingly I would be disappointed if they attempted to continue major any further, it has been finished perfectly and let it stay that way.

As they cast soul after soul into the darkness, a new sinister force is watching them: a little girl named Kikuri. 
 
While Ai continues her duties, she meets a boy named Takuma Kurebayashi, known as the ""Devil's Child"" because of the horrific events that occur around him. Unfortunately, Takuma's reputation leads the townspeople to use him as a scapegoat for those who have been ferried off to hell. When things quickly spiral out of control, Ai must find a way to bring an end to this senseless violence, as it poses a threat to her very existence. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']","""Hey, did you hear about Hell Correspondence? They say if you submit someone's name there you can send that person to hell"". These ever spreading rumors have given Enma Ai the chance to fill the pits of Hell with many a soul hardening her heart with every request sent to her. 
 
The second season continues with more hatred and suffering as this well designed story advances revealing details about the main characters in an endless chain that mimics reality, it proves to us over and over again what hatred does to us, it turns us into something inhuman. 
 
One of the various improvements made since the first season are the way episodes start and progress that way you don't have the feeling you've seen this before.Also something I have appreciated about this anime is that it slowly presents you everything, rather than suddenly dropping it on you. Another improvement is the introduction of Kikuri which you soon realize, is the complete opposite of Enma Ai with her playful personality and mischievous acts. The fact that makes her intriguing is that nothing is revealed about her until the final episode. 
 
Oh look it's 00:00 am... what are you going to do?

          
 
       Helpful So... this is what disappointemt tastes like. Like piss-soaked cardboard, if you ask me. 
 
If you're already familiar with my earlier review of the first season of Hell Girl, you should already know, that I loved the first season. It had it's annoyances, yes, but overall, it was very good piece of work. So, with no doubt, I was generally excited to hear that there indeed was a second season for one of my favourite animes... with original japanese voices, what whatever! I looked it up, watched it... and afterwards, I was so disappointed, that I actually cried blood!  
 
As for a short recap... in the first season of Hell Girl, the Hell Link was just about this urban myth about a website where you can in the stroke of midnight write down a name of the person that you wish being sented to Hell - of course, no one knows anything about the subject of payment... which is stupid, but to me, it gives a really nice edge. No one took the rumors seriously, until our victim of the week had someone they truly wished for a revenge, and oh boy did they deserve to be punished - in the first season, mind you... not in this one! We had bullies stuffing that one girl's... undercarriage with a glass pipe, and threathening to brake it! We had that one crazy lady, that inherited big cash, killed her family, and took that one girl as a hostage, and killed her puppies, just for funcies, and that crazy family, with obsession for dolls... just to name the view! All royally fucked up people, and I just loved to see them being sented to Hell! What did we got in this season? Well... some dude spilled some coffee on top of some other dude, and scratched his car. Wow... that's hardcore (read my loud sarcasm). 
 
The formula of the plot stays pretty much the same, as it was in the first season, but only in this season, the pay-up isn't even closely as satisfying, as it was in the first season. The Hell Link isn't anymore as much as some silly urban legend, but almost like some basic common knolewdge, as simply and freguently used, as facebook, or twitter! When the first season showed us some actual predicaments, with victims and true despair, this season gives us just some pesky nuicanses, with shallow means and little to no meaning, all easily removed by simply opening this one website, and sending that nuicanse to the Hell! I like revenge as a way to tell the stroy, or as a plot point, but only, if the revenge is deserved... and, in here, it really isn't! At some point, we do get this weird side story about this one kid, being called the Devil's child by his entire village, and soon afterwards, the whole town starts sending each other to the Hell... for whatever reasons they can come up on that day! Maybe the laundry isn't done! Maybe the rice is cold! Maybe he can't sing! Maybe I don't like her hair! It's all the same to me! ""It's not like my grievance is brought to me by some psycho murderer, or a false marriage, or a rape baby... I'm just gonna use this link I wound from the internet, and send my neighbor to Hell, because his face makes my baby cry!"" Is it already obvious, of why I hate this season so much?! It took that one thing, that it should have been kept the same, and it ruined it... in so many ways! 
 
Another thing, that I wasn't so keen on, was the side stories of the Hell Girl's helpers - that old guy, hottie in japanese style, and and steaming-hot honey in kimono. As I said in my earlier review, I saw them more appealing to me, when I knew the absolute minimun out of them... which in return contradicts my absolute love and passion for deep, multi-dimensional characters. I didn't need to know, who they were, where they came from, or what kind of people they were... or are, for that matter - it was more scarier to me, when the victims were dealing with something that even I couldn't quite understand. In this season, we do get to know a whole lot more about all of them, who they were and how they came to serve Ai Enma in her guest - which could be a huge plus to someone else - but it really didn't bring anything interesting, or absolutely essetial to the story! I don't want these characters to be people, but some morally grey entities, that'll send me to Hell, if I happen to live in this looney-ville full of crazy people, and my happen to step on someone's shoes! And, oh... just to get this out of my system... I really did hate Kikuri! I really did! Brat... 
 
But, since I don't wish any of the fans to write my name down to the Hell link, I guess I have to say something nice... about this season, that is. The art was indeed marvellous, and the music was beautiful - especially the ending song... so lovely! But, other than that, the merits end there. The stroy wasn't any good, the characters were given the time of day that I never ever asked for them to have, thus cutting down the energy to create actually interesting revenge-stories, and the enjoyment was... Well, let's just say that I still taste the piss-soaked cardboard! It was lazy, it was stupid, and that whole ""town becoming crazy""- storyline was just laughably absurd, that I was just waiting, when the whole town sets itself to fire, thus sending them all to Hell all in once! Now that would've been funny... instead of drowning children in the lake! 
 
I would have gladly skipped this season, and not miss a thing, if I would've known for the advance, what was coming to me! If I'd have to recommend this sequel to somebody... I couldn't do it, even if I'm being sented to Hell for it. It isn't any good, and if you already liked the first season, skip this and start with the third. Trust me... you don't wannt to cry blood!

This is mainly due to fans of the (excellent) Zone of the Enders PS2 games who prefer the darker tone of the rest of the franchise as compared to the more upbeat and humorous Dolores, i. If the former is what you're looking for, then you'd rather be watching ZOE: Idolo, but by doing so, you would also miss out on one of the most delightful and unique mecha series ever conceived. 
 
Generally, mecha shows tend to fall into two categories: Boisterous and outrageous (think: TTGL) or grim and serious (think: Gundam). Dolores, i is one of the few series which doesn't quite fit into either. It has the lightheartedness of a super robot show and the realism of a real robot show without the utter absurdity or relentless angst that usually accompany them.  In fact, Dolores, i subverts many of the typical cliches you would come to expect from a mecha show. There's no whiny teenage protagonist here; instead, you get James Links, a grizzled, middle-aged working class space trucker and the father of two fully grown working class children, who compose the rest of the main cast along with the the title character, Dolores. Dolores is the star of the show and may make or break the series for many people; she's a rosy pink mecha with the personality and naivete of a sheltered teenage girl, and yes, she talks. Her antics contribute to much of the humor of the show and her development as a character, while not particularly original (think: I, Robot) is still quaintly executed and ends up being surprisingly moving. This is bound to be too silly to some people, but it's a fresh idea in the series and is actually quite charming in practice. 
 
While Dolores is a great character on her own, the rest of the main cast is just as excellent and is undoubtedly one of the best things about this show.  The aforementioned James Links is a fresh of breath air, and is one of the most down to earth and sympathetic main characters I've ever seen in this genre. He's an everyman with a sense of humor, but also a man down on his luck, bordering on alcoholism and trying to keep the fracturing relationship between him and his children, Noel Links, an affable and tomboyish construction worker, and Leon Links, an image-conscious salaryman lacking self-assurance, intact, who blame him for their mother's death. His luck appears to get even worse when on a trucking job, he is framed for murder by space pirates attempting to steal his cargo. But when the cargo turns out to be an Orbital Frame (read: mecha) named Dolores, who holds a message for him coming from his long lost wife, Rachel, his goal in life shifts to finding the woman he presumed to be long dead, with his children going along with him being forced to by unfortunate circumstances. This journey takes them between all sorts of destinations in Earth and Mars, all while being chased as fugitives by police as well as a mysterious organization seeking to recapture Dolores and strengthening the bond between the main cast, whose internal struggles are relatable and whose growth as characters are soundly satisfying.  
 
The plot isn't a work of genius, but it serves well as a vehicle to move the characters from scenario to scenario and manages to reach a thrilling climax and conclusion. The show moves at a perfect pace, never staying on any scene for too long and achieving a perfect balance between comedy, action and drama. The show has a charming and genuinely funny sense of humor without becoming too childish or absurd. The action scenes are directed and choreographed well enough, but aren't particularly outstanding. They get the job done, but make no mistake, this is not the show to watch if you're looking for pure action. Don't expect sterling production values, either. The animation and soundtrack are just about average, meaning they're nothing worth noting, but they're also not bad enough to be distracting. The animation is acceptable and the soundtrack is used appropriately without being memorable. The art fares similarly; it's unimpressive, but the character designs are still attractive and the mech designs are eye-catchingly sleek. 
 
In conclusion, ZOE: Dolores, i is a fun, tongue-in-cheek mecha show with a heart and a sense of humor which isn't completely brain dead. It's a solid show from all angles and comes as an easy recommendation to anyone yearning for a good adventure romp. Very under appreciated series.

          
 
       Helpful This anime really is a lost jewel in its genre. The magic of its scenario transcends time (alright, it is quite pompous but still!). 
 
Scenario : 7/10 
 
A father wanders through space (and troubles) and involves his children inadvertently and tries to make peace with them, while trying to protect an Orbital Frame (yeah, a mecha) and to find his wife that was supposed to be deceased. 
 
Art : 8/10 
 
The anime is drawn in a realistic manner that didn't age at all. I really enjoyed it, no flashy colours, no exaggerated features,  maybe lacking some emotions 
 
Sound : 9/10 
 
The OST is incredible. There are some really dark tracks and some epic combat tracks absolutely awesome. The ED is also really sad and beautiful although I didn't like the OP. 
 
Chara : 8/10 
 
Perfectly human reactions. Anger, Revenge, Pride, utter confusion, Joy, Sorrow, everything is depicted with utmost accuracy. This anime is a poem on human feelings. 
 
Enjoyment : 8/10 which is the final grade i gave

          
 
       Helpful There shouldn't be any beating around the bush when it comes to ZOE. If you liked the games, watching this series and the OVA is highly recomended. 
It's a very good spin-off that fits nicely into the continuity and expands it's lore. 
 
However, if you are unfamiliar with the games - it's just a solid adventure title. It involves characters that change and evolve, cool mecha action and the level of tragedy that will most likely leave you satisfied. Despite not being deeply drammatic/pscychological as similiar looking shows tend to try it's still original. 
 
Also unlike some other adaptations done without regarding the newcommers ZOE Dolores doesn't require you to be familiar with the original source material. Everything is explained and some of the events even expand on the subject matter present in the games. 
 
It's sort of a hidden gem. I really suggest you to check it out if you just want to have a good time.

 A perfect end to an amazing anime series. (I hope it's not really the end) =( 
 
 It was so great to see Hiro and Sae graduate. The composition of frames set up during the entire second episode for the OVA was so well done. SHAFT did an excellent job showcasing how much Yuno-chi was being affected by Hiro and Sae graduating and eventually having to move out. Yuno was moved, as were as all the other girls and as such, I too was moved . . . to tears.  
 
 To recap from all the other reviews I have done about Hidamari Sketch. A story about 4 girls (then 6), Yuno-chi (Main Focus), Miya-chan, Hiro, Sae, Nori and Nazuna who live out their lives in an apartment right across from Yamabuki High. We have characters of many spectrums: shy/reserved, timid, nervous, eccentric, simple minded, caring, loving, motherly; honestly so many terms could be used to describe the girls. 
 
 It's a slow rolling adventure about essentially nothing: eating foods with your friends, going to school, going to the bath houses, just celebrating life and all that occurs within it. All the girls except for Miya-chan have some sort of problems that they face, whether it's Hiro's weight problem, Yuno-chi's lack of direction, Sae's confidence etc. etc., they all feel real and are handled very well through all 4 seasons. Yoshinoya-sensei continues to be cute all the way throughout and Natsume will forever remain the girl with a crush so great, she can't do anything about it. I'm really glad that Natsume had more screen time in x Honeycomb and her scene in the OVA too; really shows how much she cares for Sae. The only thing I wish we could have seen more of was Chika-chan, Sae's younger sister. She is incredibly cute, with an attitude and personality that is quite different from Sae herself. I honestly thought that she was going to join her sister and live in the Hidamari Apartment when she became a high school student. 
 
 The art style that SHAFT uses is so adorable and cute, polka dots and great art, blending in real life items with their style, pastel colors and vibrant ones too. Never once did I feel the colors or art style were too aggressive or boring, I love it. I love all the outfits that the girls used when not in their school uniforms, I love how the outfits always had this layer drawn on-top that, when the outfits moved, more of that ""on-top"" layer would be shown. I have no idea how to call that technique, but it's so mesmerizing. The entire series showcases how the art style of a company matures and becomes greater than ever before, I think.  
 
 The music used throughout the entire series is quite amazing. Background music is played when it makes sense, always lending more emotions to the scene at hand. The openings and endings used are all fantastic, with the openings always being peppy, cheerful, quick to bring excitement to you, where as the endings are always slower in pace, use a more relaxing melody and have beautiful singers for your ears to experience. Music from Hidamari Sketch alone is quite amazing to listen to and when combined with the art style, the show goes past the stratosphere becoming an amazing series of music and art. 
 
 Hidamari Sketch.... as a whole entity, is without a doubt a fantastic and great slice of life. The girls, the slice of life story, the relationships, the entire thing.... just so good ~.The way the episodes are played out, throwing the viewer into relationships already built and confusing us, works so well in the end. Reason why Hidamari Sketch is out of order!. By the end of this series, I felt so connected to the characters and story that was occurring, it was incredible. 
 
 10/10. I love this anime. So glad I was able to experience it. 

          
 
       Helpful Five seasons of sunshine wrapped up in two little OVAs. 
 
I was very surprised by the way they treated the OVAs. Watching the trailers, I was sure they were going to be heart-wrenching passionate episodes with tear-jerking music and ""namida ga ippai"" that would trigger an international waterworks show. Yet after watching these episodes, I couldn't help but feel...a bit warm inside. Sure, they were sad, and it leaves a sense of emptiness knowing that if this wonderful series is to continue, Sae and Hiro will no longer be main characters. But they also fill the emptiness with a sort of joy, a sense of satisfaction, of completeness, of unity. 
 
Looks like the Hidamari Series was able to stay sunny till the end. 
 
Story (8/10) 
Art (8/10) 
Sound (8/10) 
Character (10/10) 
Enjoyment (9/10) 
 
The way they treated the two episodes was quite nice, one dedicated to the exams and results and the other dedicated to the graduation ceremony. I liked the lack of overlap, and the way the first prepared you mentally for the second. 
 
The art is as per Hidamari style. Even though I started off hating it, it's really grown on me through the years. The music also, nothing special, just wonderful touching graduation goodness. Seriously, the Japanese get such amazing music for graduation while we Westerners are stuck with Pomp and Circumstance... 
 
Oh, Miyako, how I love you and your amazing sense of wit! Was it just me, or did she ramp up her teasing of Hiro by like 10x? Otherwise, the characters are really maturing. Nori not so much, but Yuno and Nazuna are really growing up, and its obvious in the way they deal with their world. Cameos from all the characters, from the Landlord to Chika, and of course, the wonderful Principal, whose speech, by the way, was totally rad. 
 
I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Hidamari Sketch with a frown on my face. Is it even possible? 
 
Overall (8/10) 
 
Hopefully, sometime in the future, we will be saying Hello once more to the residents of the Hidamari Apartments.

          
 
       Helpful Cried.  
 
A masterpiece, this series will cure your depression and teach you that life is worth living. The first few seasons are slow paced and calm, allowing you to warm up to the characters and the way the episodes work. Then the pace picks up and the days get more excited and there is literally sunshine everywhere.  
 
If you haven't watched this series yet, there's no good reason why not.

... 
... 
... 
Still here? Okay, sit down while I tell you just why this anime is awful. This is going to be a tough one because I will have to fight the urge to break into a rant. 
 
Warning: This review is assuming you've seen the 1st season, so it may contain some spoilers regarding it. There are also some VERY minor spoilers for this season. You've been warned. 
 
Story 
 
I'll give it this: I understand what was happening now. That, and it somewhat follows Gai (our supposed MC) a bit more. That being said, don't expect much out of this anime in terms of story. It's full of plot holes, inconsistencies, and general moments that'll leave you going "".... what?"" 
 
I'd go into more detail, but so little happens that if I told you anything, I'd pretty much spoil a quarter of the show. 
 
Characters 
 
Easily the worst part of this show. 
 
Gai is still the generic angsty anti-social douche that he was before. Well, okay, he's SOMEWHAT better (in that he's less of a dick), but it's hardly worth mentioning. Even after two seasons of this show, I cannot tell you anything about who he is. All I know is he's angsty and he has a thing for his (adoptive) sister. 
 
Sayaka is Gai's adoptive sister who wants to jump his bones. That's about all there is to her character. Well, that, and she leads Shin one at one point. Seriously, there's nothing to her character other than her obsession with Gai, and they interact so little that it leaves you questioning why.  
 
Shin is our 3rd main character and wielder of the second Shiryu who hates violence and has a hard on for Sayaka... that's it. He's meant to be Gai's foil, but that's about it.  
 
If you're noticing a trend, it's that they're all generic one dimensional characters without any depth. At points, they do TRY to give some depth (particularly at Gai and Sayaka's relationship), but it's either flat or my interest in the series waned so much to the point that I didn't even care anymore and instantly forgot most of it. 
 
There are also a bunch of other characters. They're not much better—actually, they might be worse. Very Minor spoiler here: One of them confronts the woman who he KNOWS killed his sister... and then he bangs her because she's hot. No really, that's the reason given. 
 
Sound 
 
Meh, not much to say. The opening is decent enough, though it's nothing to cry home about. I'd tell you more, but I don't remember anything in regards to its soundtrack outside of the opening. There's no real track that's memorable in the slightest. 
 
The VA's were serviceable (note: I watched the English dub). They're not great, but they do it well enough enough that its not too bothersome. 
 
Art 
 
So, this is probably the only thing in the show that isn't completely awful. It's not great, but it's serviceable. That being said, it does have quite a few flaws. 
 
Busoma are still 3D monsters that look completely out of place with the mostly 2D animation, the sword fighting itself lacks any weight or impact, and the characters hardly move and when do, they're rather stiff. I can only assume there were budget problems, but they could've at least added some style to the fighting to make up for it. 
 
Of course, that's assuming they even show the fighting. I cannot tell you how many times where the fighting just starts to amp up, only to cut away to something completely unrelated. Picture this: It's the final big battle! The fight the show has been building up to since season 1! The opponents finally begin to fight.... only to cut away to two other characters eating noodles. That's not a joke; it happens. 
 
As a result, you just can't get excited for the fighting, which leads to the next part... 
 
Enjoyment 
 
There's none to be found. Who is this anime made for? 
 
Alright the characters are boring. Maybe it can be like SAO and at least gimme some eye-candy? Nope, it cuts away from the fighting too much and the visuals are pretty average at best. There's nothing in this anime that's worth watching, except to see an example of how such a cool sounding premise can be wasted. 
 
Overall, just avoid this show. I thought that maybe this season might redeem it by not needing all the build up season 1 was supposedly giving, but I was wrong. It's just a poorly written mess.

          
 
       Helpful This review contains a few spoilers. 
 
In my opinion this anime had lots of potential, though the poor writing really pissed me off. I was extremely anticipating the second season of Sword Gai: The Animation because at the time when I was fairly new to anime, I never noticed the many flaws of this show. This is my first review so bare with me... 
 
 
 
Story: 8/10 
 
The whole concept was very captivating. When I read the description I instantly knew I wanted to watch season one. I found Gai's past to be somewhat unique compared to other backstories of other protagonists (such as Ryouta Sakamoto from Btooom!). I also liked the fact that it got adrenaline rushing through my veins as I watched. The writing seemed a bit abrupt for me at some parts, though. Gai attempts to commit suicide though he survives because he was healed...If you're going to make Gai jump off of a building and land face-first onto the pavement and have him survive, you should've just had him visibly considering it, then have some other way of him meeting Himiko.  
 
Art: 7/10 
 
Animation-wise, this anime isn't so horrible. None of the movements of the characters seemed unnatural to me as I watched this series. The fight scenes were well choreographed and enhancing. Whenever one of the fight scenes were on and I was eating, I'd always put the plate down at wait for it to finish. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
 
Not too bad with the sound either. I found myself really enjoying the music. Especially the OP. 
 
Character: 5/10 
 
The character design was half-decent. Some characters were dull and some weren't. Shin Matoba was one of my favorite design-wise. He reminded me of Shiro from K. 
  
Enjoyment: 1/10 
 
Okay. This is where I start to thoroughly explain why I'm not too fond of this anime. The second season really bothered me due to the fact that all the characters from season one seem to be thrown away (as in die) and replaced by the season two characters. It also somewhat didn't feel like Gai was the protagonist anymore. Too much was going on and I would've preferred if they had kept the season one characters alive longer rather than killing them off and replacing them (especially Marcus). Starting deep character development on characters in the first season and make them die in the second season that just seems downright pointless to me. If they were just going to have that happen then I'd rather have the story have less characters so it can focus more on Gai. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
I was really disappointed because I was looking forwards to Sword Gai: The Animation's second season being released. As disappointed as I was, you should still give this anime credit. If you're looking to pass the time with nothing else to do, watch this anime.

          
 
       Helpful Story 4/10 
The story is decent, as it was telling you about human corrupted and possessed by a cursed weapon and the user that have not been completely controlled by the weapon fight themself and the possessed weapon user, like in the first season, the strory continued around Gai, Sayaka, Grimm, and Shoshidai, the story develop itself in an good pace, equally divided the time for all the events, but the story end one by one by an tragic end, maybe because the point of this story is to see people try his hard not to be possesed and what happend around if they failed to contain it, after much death the  ending(MC) is decent one, compared to other character, of course. Although i was sad seeing some character dies, feeling weird when our MC and M Heroine did not die so easilly as the other, such miracle!(LOL) so i think the story is good, but because some aspect of it weirdly unfair i will rate it as Decent. 
 
Art 6/10 
I cant say much because compared to other senpai that always give review away i was a newbie, The art is good, the combination of the CG battle and traditional Anime art was well balanced, the battle is good to watch, i feel like if this anime is a total-war anime about nation fighting other nation with that possesed form is enjoyable to watch, but whatever, it is good enough to me to keep watch it. 
 
Sound 7/10 
To my opinion the sound is good, when Shiryu possesed a person the voice is really dark, like a real demon the soundtrack also good, the seiyuu is good, perfectly match every character personalities. i personally like Ztolgweinn 
 
Character 6/10 
Fairly good, matching the sound,  the design are good the balance is good the is ugly person, normal person, pretty person, handsome person and many more, because of all the differences all character is well-remembered by me, even the side-character, i would hard to remember if the face is same-designed with only it hair has different color(LOL) the cg is good! the movement is is nicely made, like a real battle but with superpower and cool armor, the belance between the 4D CG and traditional Anime art is good, it blended perfectly, i didnt feel weird seeing 3D CG Character interacting to Anime 2D Character in this anime. 
 
Enjoyment 4/10 
Really i know the point of the story is about giving in to despair, fight hard and you will win somehow, but come on the story about other character beside MC and MH is really warped up i could say most of the character had a Bad End, if they were the MC, really making my imagination hoping for something but then that chara goes to Bad End -,-, god da*m i dint enjoy that 
 
Overall 4/10 
well iam sorry i that i just had 4 on this anime, the unsettling end in every episode last minute causes me to keep watching, although some part that i disliked and i think was not too important was skipped(Sorry! Just a bit!)

The specials are mainly just Mei conversing with herself (or the cat?). There's no consistency in the specials whatsoever. You might argue that there's pretty much nothing. The third special—for instance— is just the cat meowing a song. It's cute, but hardly anything worthy watching. 
 
The episodes take roughly ten minutes to get through, but that's if you're even up for it. I don't think you have to 'regret' watching this as long as you don't expect it to be funny.

There technically aren't any characters, however, there are some abstract looking 3d shapes that dance around the screen, as though they are being personified. It's cute and some nice, trippy animation if you've got six minutes and wanna see what computer animation was like in its infancy. 
 
This was also the first project ever from Polygon Pictures. Which is a pretty good an accurate name for a studio that made short films about shiny polygons morphing shapes on screen.

       Helpful 9 Seasons later and the girls have finally formed their own idol group! The intro to Teekyuu finally brings closure to a gag established a fair few seasons back. The 9th Season of Teekyuu is here, and it’s largely the same Teekyuu you know and love. 
 
Since this is a short series, this is gonna be a short review with mostly short sentences. I liked how Yuri was made the Boke briefly in the Birthday episode. I liked the introduction of the 2 new side characters, Tennouzu Airu and Kiyozumi Shirakawa and how the series didn’t just throw them aside as one-off gags but actually developed them (however briefly). I liked the 100th episode which was essentially a character ranking episode but with the good ol’ Teekyuu twist. I liked how Marimo was the Tsukkomi for 2 episodes. Toma-Tomarin!  
 
Teekyuu 9 excels at what Teekyuu normally excels in, frantic pacing and machinegun jokes. Although, this season’s pacing is noticeably slower than all the other seasons, with one episode even featuring an eyecatch and another episode featuring a beat panel! It’s not as slow as the dreadfully dull Usakame, but it is a bit offputting at times, especially if you’re used to the series’ madness by now. Despite being 30 seconds longer, the extra 30 seconds are dedicated to the frankly mediocre ED  (Yes Teekyuu has an ED now and it’s basically idol shilling), but one wonders if the extended length contributed to the slower pacing. Think Yama no Susume when it got extended from 2-minute shorts to full episodes.  Also there were some minor continuity errors but this didn’t impact my enjoyment of the show.  Still, some jokes do benefit from the series’ new slower pacing, such as the aforementioned beat panel or the ending to the Marimo Tsukkomi episode. 
 
All in all, Teekyuu 9 is a return to form after the quite frankly miserable 6th and 7th Seasons. A bit slower, but still the same Teekyuu goodness. Part of your 5-A-Day! 
 
And as usual, if you’re a fan of the series, you’d have already watched it at least 3 times. But if you’re curious, you could always start here. Or marathon the series from episode 1 if you’re brave enough. Don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal when your nose starts to bleed at around the 30-minute mark.

19,31560,65,5.490170532,Anime with an ensemble casts,Miss Monochrome The Animation 3,Third season of  Miss Monochrome: The Animation .,"['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","I seriously did not know there was a third season for Miss Monochrome: The Animation, but after I saw the listings of anime for Fall 2015, I knew I had to watch it. I know I am pretty late to review it since it’s 2016 but who knew it would come out so soon after the second season?  
 
Anyway, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3’s storyline takes place right after the second season.  In this season, Miss Monochrome’s album has finally been released and she is now preparing her tour to become more famous. From my point of view, it seems as if this season was similar to the first one. Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3 brings that over-the-top comedy back with a new reference in each episode. I was really surprised to see that they brought this element back but in the back of my mind, knowing how each episode was set up made it feel repetitive. With that being said, the story may not feel like it progresses, but it does. Speaking about references, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3 references events that happened in the first and second season. If you haven’t seen the first and second season, I advise you to do so. 
 
There’s not a lot to say about the characters. There’s no major addition or anything of the sort. Yayoi is still the same overambitious klutz, Maneo is still trying to do whatever he can to help, Miss Monochrome is still trying to become famous, and Ruu-chan is being Ruu-chan. Mana and Kikuko make an appearance from time to time but not as often as before. The backup idol group for Miss Monochrome, Caramel, gets a little more air time though. 
 
Needless to say, the art style of Miss Monochrome was enhanced. The character designs look more detailed and the environment is a little more vivid as well. The 3D CGI for Miss Monochrome has improved dramatically such as the lighting and detail. If you were tired of seeing the same old outfit Miss Monochrome had on, do not worry. Miss Monochrome has a different outfit in the new ending which makes it refreshing to see. 
 
Something that should be noted is that there are two opening and ending theme songs now. The first opening and ending theme songs are “Black or White” and “Step by Step”. Both first OP and ED theme songs were the same from the second season, but had a few new animations included. On the other hand, from episode 10 and on, the opening and ending theme songs are “Miss Monochrome Taiso” and “Kimi to Boku”. I really wished that they changed the opening and ending theme songs in the beginning. To me, it didn’t make sense that they would put a good theme song near the end of an anime; I found it to be very disappointing since I was only going to hear it for three episodes.  
 
There’s no doubt that I enjoyed Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3. There was always something to look forward to in every episode. Be it a random promotion for a game or subtle fan service, it was all fun to watch. However, I disliked how this season didn’t show some characters in the previous seasons and incorporate them into the story. I was really hoping to see Akiko, the famous guitarist, to make an appearance, but she didn’t sadly. We got to see more of the story side in the second season, however in this, it’s very similar to the first. A lot of random references that incorporate into the story that just so happens to make a plot. To me, it felt repetitive, the randomness was cool and all, but like I said, I knew how each episode were set up. 
 
Overall, this season seemed to be better than the second but not as much as the first. Maybe we’ll get to see a season 4? I don’t think that this is the end of Miss Monochrome’s journey to idol hood, but who knows what Miss Monochrome will do next?

The visuals are great, the story is in fact quite good, still a somewhat a cliche, but it works! ^^

 The animation for this show was done by Madhouse. The quality of animation and backgrounds were incredible. Everything was so bright, and the backgrounds were so beautiful. Also when the characters move it was like they were walking on the skies. It looked very good and matched the rest of the animation perfectly.

 The song Perfect Day, is done by Supercell and song by Yanagi, Nagi, who has the most beautiful voice i have ever heard. When you know shes the singer, you know that it be anything but amazing. It's a very calm song to start with, but grows though out the song. It felt like i was being told a story from start to end. There was so much feeling in the song. Nagi's voice together with the  sound, made this song my personal favorite song.

 Once again it should be hard to judge the characters by just looking at them. Now that's not the case here. You can see how they feel and what they've been though by just looking at them.

Good-by(e) Marilyn is one of Tanaami Keiichi western-culture-fangasm films.  In this one, he butchers Marilyn Monroe.  Take a moment to click on her character profile and study that image for a bit.  Despite being hideous in all manners, that one is relatively okay.  They get way worse, especially in the second half of the film when Tanaami’s libido suddenly hit maximum overdrive.  Pretty sure there’s a bit where she’s attempting to shove a plane up her vagina, but I’m not all that good at this whole visual metaphor thing so maybe I misinterpreted that.  Occasionally a real life image of Marilyn Monroe will appear as much needed eye bleach.  Superman also makes an appearance for some reason.

In truth fans of One Piece will get a bigger kick out of watching this then people who aren't familiar with the anime, it's more or less made for them. The story in the film is typical One Piece affair with one thing unexpected happening, resulting in the crew trying to resolve the situation while something else happens that will interlock with the main plot and then the situation is sorted through the power of courage and friendship. 
 
Watching this was just like watching the series except with a higher degree of animation and it is the quality of animation that makes the film shine. One Piece episodes around the time of 2002 looked okay but the movie quality allows for some really smooth character animation and richer colours for backgrounds which really adds to the overall experience. The characters in the film are just as good as they are in the series and in terms of sound and music they happen to be in good supply too. Overall I really liked the film just because it was One Piece in a higher quality animation; it's definitely worth the watch if you can't get enough of the One Piece adventures.

Let's talk about ""One Piece: Chinjuujima no Chopper Oukoku"", the third One Piece's movie. 
This movie is like the first two movies, it only lasts barely one hour. And to be honest, it was enough... 
 
•Story (02/10): 
This movie, released in 2002, is centered on Chopper which became the new king of a kingdom that is just an island filled with animals (well, except a living human among them). 
 
The story is very basic, and suffers from an unattractive scenario that will never seduce us. 
The overall humor of the movie is troublesome, and the actions performed by the protagonists are constantly meaningless. 
 
•Art (04/10): 
I've never been a fan of the art in one piece, in general, and this movie is not an exception.  
It's colourful, animals are poorly drawn, and  wicked people in this movie are pathetically ugly and without charisma 
 
•Sound (06/10): 
Best thing of the movie. Nothing special, nothing notable.  
Nevertheless, I can not deny that music in general , in this movie, liberates a very nice nostalgic feeling, which make me think of an pleasant 80's OST! 
 
•Character (01/10): 
(I do not talk about One Piece's character in general, but only about those who appear in this movie.) 
They are all PATHETIC. 
Mobambi, the main character in this film is annoying as f... and his story is just ridiculous. We don't care about him, and we'll never be. 
Beside, we don't care about animals, because they're not talking, and because they are useless. 
Furthermore, the wicked.... any charisma, useless, as weak as an atrophied cow.... I just want to forget them. 
 
•Enjoyment (02/10): 
This movie is annoying, frustrating, boring... 
I never managed to get into it , and the time seemed interminable . 
 
•Overall (02/10): 
""One Piece: Chinjuujima no Chopper Oukoku"" is a bad One Piece movie, and a very very very bad movie in general. 
Even if you want to watch every One Piece movies, I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH IT. You'll waste your time, with an hideous way...

          
 
       Helpful One Piece Movie 3 : Chinjuujima no Chopper Oukoku Review 
 
 
Story (6/10) Fair 
 
The story in the third movie of One Piece is fair, as you can tell this movie is Tony Tony Chopper orientated it'll focus on him a lot more than the other characters, which is fine but I do think the fact that Chopper doesn't get the final shine against the main antagonist in this movie it kind of disappointed me. I understand that Chopper isn't that type of character and he did give it his all and when he was actually fighting the main antagonist he was use all of his abilities. I'm just saying that it would have been cool in that One Piece movie that goes down have the Tony Tony Chopper One Piece movie that he would have been the one to do the concluding blow but it is what it is. 
 
 
Art and Animation (7/10) Good  
 
For the 3rd movie in the One Piece Movies and literally coming out almost exactly a year after it's previous movie you would assumed that it would look a tad bit more updated than the last one. When it actuality the art style in this one reminds me more of the first movie without it's animation. The animation in this one I think was better than the 2nd movie but not as good as the first. Either way it's still good but for movie standards it definitely could have been better but I think since they are farting these movies out almost annually now that quality when it comes to animation wouldn't be seen that often even by anime movie standards.  
 
 
Sound (8/10) Very Good  
More Specifically (8.5/10) Very Good+ 
 
The authentic JP voices and BGM are all heard in this movie which required and applaud but the reason why I'm giving this section just a little extra points is because of the outro music played at the end of the movie stood out to me it was very very good.   
 
 
Characters (9/10) Great   
 
The Straw Hat Crew is slowly getting bigger as this is the first movie Chopper debuts in. All of the characters we know up to this point are present and are entertaining nothing really wrong with them. The movie characters and villains ok not better than the previous movies but not bad enough to nitpick on any level in my opinion. 
 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) Good 
 
This movie didn't have me at the edge of my seat but it didn't put me to sleep either. It was entertaining enough for me not to feel like I wasted my time with it. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if someone ask me how I enjoyed I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it. The movie was over before I knew it so it didn't felt like it dragged on anywhere so that's a good thing in my book because to other two I felt had that issue to an extent. 
 
 
Overall (7/10) Good 
More Specifically (7.50/10) Good+ 
 
Since we are around the point where these movies are going to come out annually I'm sure the quality most likely will drop. I've heard the only two movies I should really judge is Strong World and Film Z any other One Piece movie is debatable if they can be considered recommendation quality and so far I can agree with this statement if you are a fan of One Piece I can so give it a shot in the dark with this one but if you are looking for something really good this might not suffice you on that level but it's not bad if that counts for anything.

And I love weird stuff, but this anime is just randomness meshed together in a blender. I’m 90% done with this series and I still don’t get it. After the first three or four episodes, each episode from then on is the back story for every character which is cool I guess but it’s so long! There are too many characters! A lot of anime has a lot of characters. But usually it focuses on just a couple first, gets you to love ‘em, then adds more. But this show doesn’t give you time to love them, you don’t get a connection with them, it seems fake in a way, and half of the characters are just unnecessary and they’re stories are random. Each characters story supposedly links to another characters story, making it all come together but I just don’t see it. I was hoping the back story episodes would stop and then have it all come together and make sense, but it didn’t whatsoever. And the beginning is just weird and doesn’t help the backstories make any sense and the backstories doesn’t make the beginning make any sense so I’m just spiraling here. I also don’t understand what the plot to this anime is and the romance is pretty bad. I’m thoroughly annoyed by this…

          
 
       Helpful First, I must ask you to bear with me because this is my first time writting a review, so Im kind of a reviews-virgin. Ok, now that thats settled I can start. 
The first thing I noticed of this anime was the art, how beautifully the characters were created, and thats no small thing, because -and I know this is wrong- but I mostly judge a book by its cover, and the same goes for animes, the first thing I do is to look at the characters and see if I like how they look or not, its kind of shallow, but well, lets continue. 
This anime has 26 episodes, the first two are centered in one character, the second two in another, the third two in another and so on, so the thing that bothered me more about this anime was there was no real plot in it. Sure, there were characters who went through terrible stuff and all, but that was like an accessory because the story revolves about how a bunch of guys all fall for the same girl. And sure, that is cute. In fact, I love reverse harem, but in Starry☆Sky there was almost none of it. It was like a reaaaally long prologue that explained how the guys got to fall in love with her, all of them in their unique way. But then theres no story, theres no romance, theres no one that tells her how he feels or how she saved them or whatever. I mean, theres no real PLOT. There are these 26 episodes in where you keep wondering when the real stuff is going to happen, when the twist of the story is going to take place. I mean, the only episode that had me crying was the last one because of the graduation an all. 
And then you wonder, then why the hell did you gave this anime and 8? Well, because I loved each and every character, because they were developed so well and because I understood them. Because sometimes they had me laughing and sometimes crying and sometimes just feeling compassion for them. That is the only reason I gave Starry☆Sky an 8, because of the characters, no for the story, but because of them. I think if you are going to watch this anime, you should do it when you are bored or taking a break from intense anime, thats all.

          
 
       Helpful I’ve been looking forward to Starry☆Sky since it was announced. I liked the majority of character designs, the emphasis on astronomy and astrology and the fact that they’d tie it in with a romantic story without panty shots and excessive boob movements every few minutes. However, this series has fallen short of my expectations. 
 
Story-wise, what caught my attention was the fact that they were using the astrological signs to make their characters. Each of the 12 signs have 2 episodes to get their story across and tie it in with Tsukiko and the final two episodes I imagine will feature the thirteenth secret character that represents the new sign, Ophiuchus. 
This leaves pacing at the extremes; either very quickly or very slow. Either way you don’t leave the arc completely understanding the character. 6/10 
 
As for characters, I still have no idea what their names are and I’ve seen the first 4 arcs. I refer to them all by their signs. Their personalities are all based on the theory behind those of the astrological signs and once again are usually not fully developed in their 20-minutes of fame. As for Tsukiko, I think she has the least development of all the characters and is very much a huge eyed mystery to me. 6/10 
 
As I mentioned before, the art was one of the things that caught me. Scrolling through the characters’ pictures I saw just about every color of the rainbow used in hair and eye color. As a reverse harem goes, it is never complete without fancy colored hair. So far Aquarius, Virgo and Gemini are the characters that stand out to me. They all have something unique that separates them from the rest. Tsukiko’s larger than normal eyes make her look a little strange and she really never stood out for me. 7/10 
 
Sound is probably best in this show. Another plus for me. The cast is all well known male seiyuu. Names like Ono Daisuke, Fukuyama Jun and Suzumura Kenichi all grace this anime with their talent. The ending theme is an instrumental piece that grabs my attention so much that I must listen to it after each episode. Like I opened with, the sound is what saves this anime. 9/10 
 
As much as the character designs and music keep me interested, I find myself thinking hard about watching the new episodes each week. Usually if I do, I don’t mind just letting the episode run and listening to the dialogue while I browse the internet. I fall asleep through the episode if I don’t. 6/10

The anime project will not only remake the best episodes from the live-action version, but also depict original episodes not seen in the live-action version. Those original episodes will include prologues of the Winchester brothers' childhood, anime-only enemies, and episodes featuring secondary characters from the live-action version.

But for the sake of a fair review, I'll try not to compare it (-much-I do compare it) with the original series. 
 
So, the story is definitely interesting. Two brothers hunting down all kinds of monsters thought to be just fictions of mythology and legends does sound appealing. The series includes remakes of the original episodes and anime-only episodes, too. As far as the latter is concerned, I believe they fitted with the original series. But the 22 episodes just wasn't enough to explain the plot thoroughly. Many questions arise and, honestly, I am not sure if I would understand the story so well if I was not familiar with the live-action series.. Lastly found the ending fair enough, I repeat for someone who is not familiar with the original. 
 
The art was a real fit. I mean the intense black in the frames fitted well with the mysterious style of the story. And, the characters were decent. But, I cannot restrain from commenting on Bobby's appearance. Man, what did they do to him???? (sorry about that). 
 
I haven't watched it in Japanese so I'll comment on the dubbed version. Okay, the voice actors have risen huge complaints. Why Jensen Ackles is not in the show? What's wrong with the voice actors? And bla bla bla... Really, the voice actors were not that bad. They could have been better and having the original cast would be sweet but we should try being just a little objective. Also, the music and the sound effects created the mysterious-creepy atmosphere the series needs. 
 
What I found a bit disappointing were the characters. I can't be objective here because I know the potential of the characters. They are not as flat as the anime portrays them. They are more deep than that. Also, many characters and monsters had to be there. What about the guys from the Harvelle's Roadhouse and the shape-shifters? However, we cannot expect that much from a 22-episode series while the original is 10 seasons! If you are new to the supernatural world I think you will like them as they are. They are not some kind of heroes, they have flaws and make mistakes. 
 
If you like this kind of stuff -demons, vampires, werewolves, etc.- you will definitely like Supernatural. Even if you don't have a particular interest in those, I believe you will still enjoy it. It is a great anime and leave us, grumpy fans, complaint. It should be treated with respect and it is a great anime for the mystery/ horror fans out there! 

          
 
       Helpful This is a creepy show. Having not seen the live-action show before, I don’t know if it does justice to the show or not but I have to say, I really like it any way and it does make me want to see the original show. The episodes all have to do with someone dying in a gruesome way, then the brothers’ end up being at the right place at the right time. Each show is its own storyline without many things to link them together. The story is slow, and not really action orientated. Many of the shows act more like detective shows where something odd happens and they discover why only to have a small action scene at the end. There is a larger mystery that they have in this show about the brothers trying to find their Dad.  
 
The art style is rather interesting, almost a cross between anime and American comic book style. The characters are hard edged, and a lot of dark lines and heavy shadows that pretty much are black. Everything has a nice vintage feeling, sort of grimy in a good way. The characters look like the characters from the live-action as well which is what I would wish to see unlike some of them. Sadly, some of the images are pretty frozen, still images that feel like cop outs, especially when this was made in 2011. 
 
The English voices don’t feel up to par with the animation, and feels a bit forced and doesn’t match the lip sink most of the time. They talk when the mouths are closed and part of it might be to get information out since this is shorter then the actual show. Even then, it just feels rushed and makes it a little hard. I really love the ending song though. I never thought I would hear “Cary on my Wayward Son” by Naoki Takao fit so well. 
 
EDIT: I have now seen the live action show, I really like it as well. The show has the same creepy feeling and the same slowness that the animation has. The stories are altered slightly from the original but that’s partly because they were putting a 1 hour episode into a half a hour one. 

          
 
       Helpful STORY:  4 
The plot seems okay.  How Mary Winchester died is still the same as it was in the original series, but it wasn't as detailed.  The flashbacks that Sam had near the beginning of episode 1 made me go ""What?"" once or twice, so I had to rewatch that scene a couple of times before I went ""Oh... Okay"". 
 
The anime desperately tries to have the same feel as the original series.  Honestly, it did have the same feel, but there was just something lacking. 
 
ART:  3 
The character designs are simply pathetic, it's too over-shaded, the characters seemed poorly planned out.  Honestly, the background characters are more eye-catching than the two main characters.  Since Madhouse was in charge of the animation, I figured that it wouldn't be too bad, but I was sadly mistaken.  I put all this horrible art to a lack of a budget.  To say the least, I was shocked when the scenery was so beautiful.  The thing that should catch your eye are the characters NOT the scenery. 
 
All-in-all, they just needed more of a budget for art since it seemed like they didn't have enough money for it. 
 
SOUND:  6 
The sound is fine, but I just feel that they could've used more fitting music.  The English voice actors did put emotion into their lines, so it wasn't dead.  I have not seen the Japanese dub, but I assume they're similar.  The sound effects seemed fitting for the anime, but sometimes the sound effects just didn't fit 
 
For the English dub, the words don't exactly fit with the lip flaps.  The sentences don't go over, they go under the amount of flaps.  It wasn't enjoyable.   
 
The ending theme wasn't the greatest because it wasn't the original, but I suppose it worked.  I guess it's debatable depending on what you like for vocals. 
 
CHARACTER:  4 
Character designs left so much to be desired.  I understand that, no matter what, the animated characters won't look like the actual actors, but I just think they could've planned out the designs more carefully.  Dean's design reminds me of someone who was put in jail for a crime.  I have nothing to say on Sam's design since it was alright.  The extras, as I said before, were better drawn. 
 
ENJOYMENT:  3 
I really do NOT care for this anime one bit.  I don't intend to watch another episode unless I'm dreadfully bored and the only other option is banging my head against a wall or playing with matches... Even then I'd probably play with matches. 
 
OVERALL:  4 
Even though the idea of turning Supernatural into an anime is good, I believe that it could've been done better.   If they didn't jump into it because anime is the ""in thing"" right now, I honestly believe it would be better.  This is one of the worst animes I've seen to date.  If you plan to watch Supernatural:  The Animation, I suggest that you don't.  Just stick with the live-action series.

I haven't read the manga. Some months ago, I found out about Heavens Lost Property and watched the series. I was astonished by the plot, the characters and the comedy it offers. Its really a great anime. Then, I found out about the first movie - The clockwork angeloid. It was a nice and emotional movie, however it did not live up to my expectations. And then we got this.. Eternal my master. 
 
Being one of the very few that have not read the manga, this movie was a disaster. Even though I really had NO idea what was going on at the first scene, I was confident that they would fill it up somehow. 
 
Boy, how wrong I was. 
 
After that scene, we are returned to the classic mood and style of HLP. Some Ecchi's we all know and love from the series, lots of fun times and that obvious, but entertaining harem part of the anime were all present. I liked the emotional part with Ikaros throughout. However, just after that part of the plot ends, the horror kicked in.. 
 
SPOILER ALERT AHEAD. STOP READING IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED YET. OVERALL, ITS BETTER NOT TO WATCH THE MOVIE IF YOU'VE NOT READ THE MANGA LIKE ME. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 
 
To my unpleasant surprise, the first scene continues, and we see Ikaros with Tomoki up in the sky. Ikaros keeps on burning, and Tomoki keeps on screaming for her to go back. Ikaros, out of the blue, tells him she's in love, and for the first time ever, we see her smile. She throws Tomoki into synapse and she gets destroyed. Then the movie ends. 
 
Yes. Just like that. Astrea was probably already dead on the first scene, Nymph died at that very time, I have NO idea what zeus is, I dont know why Sugata is hurt, I never learned what happened to the blue-haired girl, I don't know how Hyiori remained alive, and finally, I have NO IDEA why Ikaros sacrificed herself to get Tomoki into synapse. What hurt me the most is that they killed off the ENTIRE cast without telling us why. This not only ruined the manga for me, because now I know that after some emotional struggles Ikaros will die, but it ruined my overall impression of the anime. I liked the characters. I knew they would probably die, but skipping the final battle, skipping Tomoki's actions after Ikaros died, skipping Astrea and Nymph's deaths, skipping Sugata's injury, skipping EVERY MAJOR PLOT POINT in a movie and expecting it to turn out good is simply unacceptable.  
 
A big, big disappointment overall.

          
 
       Helpful To me, the Sora no Otoshimono series really is the pinnacle of its genre when it comes to harem/fanservice shows (which I do enjoy quite a bit). The manga and the first two seasons were really great and the first movie, while not nearly as good as those, was at least watchable and somewhat enjoyable. This? They butchered the story and most other good things about the show. To call the ending ""rushed"" would be an understatement. Well, the end of this ""movie"" (which is barely the length of two episodes) barely qualifies as an ending. The shear amount of plot from the source material that this movie glosses over is absurd. As for the humor, that's the only thing saving this movie from a 1 or a 2 rating in my book. There's a few decent laughs to be had here and there, but even those aren't up to par with the original show or the manga. 
 
The animation is also weaker than previous installments for this anime. The two seasons and first movie are very well animated. This movie maintains the same style, but with much less effort being put into animation and soundtrack than before. 
 
Scores: 
Story: 1/10 
Animation: 4/10 
Sound: 5/10 
Characters: 5/10 
Enjoyment: 3.5/10 
Overall: 3/10 
 
If you enjoyed the show or the manga, you might get a laugh or two from this movie. That's about it. The story achieves Infinite Stratos 2 levels of badness (but at least IS had more going for it in other categories) and the overall production is just really low-effort as well. If you're a Sora no Otoshimono fan, you're not missing anything by skipping this movie.

          
 
       Helpful This review will be from a very nuubie perspective, I dont plan on giving anything away. So there shouldn't be any risk of spoilers, that is IF you decide to watch the movie. This review is written from the perspective of someone who has followed the anime and not the manga of the series. 
 
What can I say about this final chapter to the Sora no Otoshimono story? I was SOO looking forward to watching it. I only learned about the series a while ago and powered through the first two seasons, finishing off with Angeloid of Clockwork. Admittedly the first movie suffered during the first half, reusing material from the show for a lot of the time. So when I learned there was a second movie, I put time aside to watch it. Snacks? Check, soft drinks? Check..Then the torture began...yes torture! If your a die hard fan of the show, then perhaps you feel the need to watch everything regarding Tomoki and the gang. Personally I WISH I had seen the reviews on here, as I might seriously had avoided watching it.  
After a meager 50 minutes of rushed incoherent story, the credits begin to scroll up the screen and I found myself sitting on the sofa with a feeling of utter disappointment. Rarely have I watched something that's left me feeling so utterly crushed. Eternal My Master is a badly paced mess of a movie, that lacks any heart or passion that made the show funny as hell to watch. The ending was so terrible, that I had to seek out the manga for the show, just to see if I had missed anything. As it turned out, I had!  
Seriously how can you make a movie so dire, when you have such amazing source material!??? Its like someone condensed the last few books to fit on the back of a napkin and handed it to the animators to work off. 
 
As it seems the creators of the show have washed their hands of the series, it's doubtful a third movie will crop up anytime soon. Heck we can hope right? But seriously, do yourself a favor, go read the manga version for the ending this show deserves. You wont find one here in this movie. 'Eternal My Master' is a shadow of the series and a mis-justice to all the fans who love it. 
 
'Angeloid of Clockwork' actually made me cry at the end, because even for all it's rehashing of old material, it was a nice story. 'Eternal My Master' was upsetting for entirely different reasons and not a single one of them good.  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 movie. Finally there would be some closure, would Tomoki finally settle on one girl?

19,27927,74,5.366346287,Anime with an ensemble casts,Urawa no Usagi-chan,"An original anime advertising Urawa City in Saitama, Japan.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']","Anyone who spends much time on ANN or other anime/Japancentric sites will know that there is seemingly nothing Japan will not use cute high school girls to advertise. From alcohol to pearl diving, there doesn't seem to be anything that doesn't have a cartoon cute girl mascot attached to it anymore. Nor is it unusual for cities in Japan to recognize & attempt to exploit the potential tourist boost that comes from having places featured on TV. Many popular anime have spawned tours of the area they're set in; which more committed fans like to visit as a way to, I guess, get more involved in their favourite shows. This has become even more true in the last few years since changes to Japans tax laws has seen regions outside the Tokyo area competing for the attention of citizens who can now ""donate"" a portion of their income tax to a specific municipality. 
 
This brings brings us to Urawa no Usagi-chan (UU), a short series that was commissioned to promote the Urawa ward of Saitama city. Usagi-chan, our nominal main character, is a cute high school girl & member of the railway club, where she & the ensemble cast of other cute high school girls drink tea, eat cakes & generally do the things cute high school girls do in every cute girl SOL show ever made, ever. None of the characters are ones you can't tell everything about just be looking at their character design, & nothing they get up to would seem out of place in any other show or, indeed, any other place in Japan. 
 
Now there's nothing wrong with a simple, short SOL. Shows like Aiura, Encouragement of Climb & Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san are recent examples of shorts that pulled it off, & UU isn't terrible, although it's nothing memorable & indeed is so by the numbers as to be rather dull. But for a show that's supposed to be promoting Urawa, it does a pretty poor job of it. By the end of its twelve episodes we've inferred that there's a railway station (by virtue of there being a railway club), they have Juumangoku buns (a small & probably overpriced sweet, steamed bun), there's Yono Park, which apparently has roses & a cake shop, & some guy who likes surfing owns a tsukune-yaki (chicken kebab, basically) restaurant. The latter two are not places the cast visit, but come up in a quiz that I can only assume was included when the Urawa tourist board called up the producers & said ""we're paying to to promote our ward, not draw pictures of little girls!"" Oh, & there's Saitama ninja ramen noodles, but that might just have been part of a joke that went nowhere. Heck Boku no Imouto wa ""Osaka Okan"" did a better job of promoting Osaka than this does for Urawa, & that series could have been re-titled Osakan's Say the Stupidest Things. 
 
While the show makes no real effort to show off Urawa, it looks like the animation studio at least went for a visit. Many of the background images have the look of being location photos that have had an oil paint filter applied. There area also a couple instances of live film being used, such as when showing the aforementioned Yono Park. The art is really what you'd expect from a show of this type. The character designs are all fairly boilerplate, but serve the purpose of making each character recognizable. The animation is fairly minimal but for a slow paced show like this one that's to be expected. It's just a shame we don't really see any of note in Urawa depicted by it. 
 
To that end, it's hard to see the point of UU. Indeed, it feels like another example of a Japanese marketing team assuming that ""moe"" & ""cute high school girls"" are all you need to sell something, even if you barely bother to mention what that thing is or tie them together. Maybe that's true, but in this instance it's hard to see who this show is aimed at or what about Urawa it's trying to promote, apart from perhaps the fact that it exists. Good to know, I suppose.

          
 
       Helpful There isn't much to say about this short anime.  
 
I think the art is nice. It's crisp, clear, and vibrant, but that's the only really memorable thing about it. Everything else is mediocre at best.  
 
I was hoping this would be an anime that personified places, but although I think that was supposed to be the plot, it was too subtle. 
 
Still, if you can waste a few minutes on a cute anime, this is probably a good one to watch.

Just personal scratch. 
Advised, possible spoilers. 
Opinion & Informal 
 
Art: 6/10 CGI characters with ""photo"" backgrounds. Anatomy not particularly believable. (Serval has two sets of ears, but I actually prefer that lol. It feels like she would be weird if it got technical and she didn't have her human ears and only her animal ears). CGI rendering and backgrounds were noticeably on the less-sharp side. New character models used for the horse-Friends that were introduced in this. Same models for the main characters. Backgrounds were ""photos"" of a horse derby building and track. 
 
Animation: 5/10 Minimal movements. Used a few single-frame scenes which can be mostly overlooked considering this is a 3-minute spin off that doesn't really add to the main series at all. It was more along the lines of a promotional piece. Decided not to animate the race between them which is a minus, but that totally would have gone over budget. 
 
Characters: 6/10 The best characters in the buisness. I'm just kidding. I just personally like Kemono Friends so I'm glad that this addition was able to add a little more life to two of my favorite characters. Objectively though this ONA did nothing to add to any of the characters as a whole, development or lore-wise. This ONA failed to be meaningful in any way to their growth or being (It did make Serval really tired though if you want to count the race and epilogue scene). 
 
Plot: 4/10 Spin-off promotional piece of sorts.  
 
Development: 5/10 Showcases some lightly dressed horse-Friends which I personally disagree with as most Friends from the main series are much more modestly dressed. Objectively, zero development to the main series plot. The two MCs find a horse derby. Meet Friends. Race.  
 
Music: 5/10 Uses the same bgm and soundboard from the main series; nothing new. No particular sound design to note in this ONA.  
 
Conclusion: 4/10 Did not animate the race which was supposed to be the climax of this ONA. Skips to the epilogue scene after presenting the promotion's advertisement bit.  
 
Overall: 5/10 Didn't add or detract from the plot or characters. Promotional piece. A nice little slice of ""extra"" to add to the Kemono Friends world.

Years later, having obtained the Number Two headband which grants him the right to challenge the Number One, Afro moves forward in his hunt for revenge on the man who murdered his father.

And I'll tell you what, they were very successful, one of the best dubbed anime I ever heard. 
 
They managed to fit everything like the art... I mean look at the details of the characters' drawings, their particular portraits, the dark ""aura"" they managed to bring from this dark world and look at cool gore scenes! A nice fitting music, enjoyable action moments and all in 5 episodes. What about Samuel Jackson's voice coming from Ninja's mouth? It is just... Awesome!! 
 
So basically, the story goes around a futuristic feudal Japan where there are two headbands: Headband no.1 and Headband no.2. The fighter who holds the No.1 is considered god-like, the best of the best and can only be challenged by the one who holds the No.2 one. However, everyone, but literally everyone, can challenge the No.2 holder for the headband, meaning lots of trouble for that guy. Afro's father was the No.1 holder and died against a character named ""Justice"". Seeking revenge, Afro got the No.2 headband and is now heading to where ""Justice"" is waiting for him.  
 
He goes on as some people try to stop and kill him to get the No.2 title and at the same time we learn about Afro's past as he was training to be a great samurai. The fighting scenes are very enjoyable and the story is very simple but it is the typical good samurai revenge story. However, the characters are not that much deeply explored and explained, unlike Afro, but I personally think that it's not necessary in this case. 
 
A nice 5-episode anime to watch in a row. Everything it needs to be an awesome samurai-way entertainment. And the final scene... It just gave me chills! :P

STORY: 6 
there actually is no plot. the main character, afro samurai (known as just afro) is on a quest to become the number 1 samurai and avenge his father's death and kill the main antagonist, Jutsice (who's number 1). thats it really. they do include afro's backstory which actually IS really interesting and very dynamic and dense. it was interesting to see how this kid became a harden killer. 
 
ART: 7 
the animation actually is very very well done. everything was pretty fluid and the fight scenes were entertaining and beautiful to watch. im not so scary about the art style as much but it wasn't ugly. the color palate chosen really intensified the barren landscape and the overall feeling of emptiness  
 
SOUND: 7 
the music kinda reminded me of samurai champloo with those hip hop vibes. i actually really enjoyed the intro song. helps form the tone of the anime right from the start. Samuel L. Jackson is a great voice actor, he did an amazing job doing ninja ninja and afro. i cant really say the same for all of the other characters. it sounded like they were just straight up reading the script with no life behind their voices. 
 
CHARACTERS: 7 
the anime is short so there really isnt much time for character development per say, however the back story really helped the audience see how far the characters have come. Geno was one of my favorite characters because of the changes made from the past to present. he was such a complex character for not really being shown in the present for too long. afro is also a very deep character, whose story is portrayed beautifully with the help of the back story, the producers did a good job. the villains on the other hand, weren't so great. they were very superficial, dry and stereotypical. they were just a bundle of pure evil with no real rhyme or reason. a little disappointing 
 
ENJOYMENT: 6 
theres something missing to this series and its frustrating because i cant really put my finger on whats missing exactly. i didnt hate the series i just wasnt wowed by any one aspect of it as much as i thought i was going to. i suppose the series just wasnt for me. it was entertaining dont get me wrong but i just felt like it was just lacking in something. it might have been the voice acting that really put a damper on the dramatic parts of the series. 
 
OVERALL: 
-plot is very basic. a common revenge plot, nothing new 
-animation was amazing. not crazy about the style.  the color palate really help make for a feeling of emptiness, sadness and fastness   
-music was on point 
-geno and afro were awesome characters with great development. ninja ninja was annoying but necessary for comic relief. villains had no depth to them. 
-voice acting overall could have used some more direction and energy. Samuel L. Jackson's performance was great though 
-not for those of the weak of heart. a lot of blood, gore, fighting. theres a sex scene there as well 
-a good anime if youre in between stuff because it's short

          
 
       Helpful I found this unique anime to be an overall enjoyable watch, if only to understand the much better film. The ghetto voices and the seedy vibe of the setting worked well with Samuel L Jackson's vocals. 
I found afro to be a very unrelatable character though I do suspect that was the intention. Comic relief is provided throughout by his verbal sidekick. Action lovers need not fear watching this however as epic sword fights occur frequently. The artwork is not brilliant by any means, the story is not extremely coherent and it is maybe too short but it is nevertheless an entertaining and action-packed anime.

Naturally, with this success, comes the inevitable jump to animation. How well did it turn out? Well this series is the story of two halves. 
 
Healing Chapter comprised the first half of the series. Something that stuck out was the sheer amount of great character interactions and heartwarming scenarios. For example, in one episode, M4 SOPMOD II creates a miniature replica of herself via the flesh of her enemies. The bond between this replica and M4A1 is surprisingly genuine for a short-form anime, and this replica ended up making a cameo later on. The humor is relatively simple but quite well done, with a charming artstyle and surprisingly good voice acting. 
 
The second half, known as Madness Chapter, is a bit of different tale. Based on 4koma comics that were released as fun little stories, these segments are far more fast-paced and humor-focused. And there are more of them. But naturally, the platitude of ""quality > quantity"" comes into play. The shorts are far too hit or miss for me. Some, such as the one with the plant fairy, are charming little snippets. Others devolve into ""geddit dakimakuras"" or ""OOPS the cats ate the food"", or just have zero build-up. It comes off a bit too childish for me at points. The animation here also wildly ranges, quite a few times stuff barely moves and in other times there are weirdly fluid motions of cat people. Character interactions are present but barely explored in favor of the previously mentioned quick gags. The voice acting is still pretty solid though. 
 
The characters themselves are in general likable but fairly one-note. I can sum up some of them as ""cat"", ""lazy"", ""drunk"", and ""crazy"". That's unfortunately the problem you get when you focus on too many characters. Healing Chapter made up for this with bouncy dynamics, but as mentioned before Madness Chapter half-assed that part. 
 
Perhaps I'd get this more if I liked the game enough, but I don't gamble on jpgs and as a secondary to the franchise, this unfortunately couldn't get me on board. If you want absurdly short, silly cartoons I could cautiously recommend it, but just know you won't be getting the most consistent experience.

          
 
       Helpful Right, well here we are. The Girl's Frontline anime we all waited what? Half a year for? And it's just a meme one, nothing like the actual game PV ;-;. That said, the non-chibi art is actually very well done like the M4 in wonderland scene. I was anticipating a semi-memey, semi-serious military anime. Got nothing I was expecting at all, apart from cute chibi sleepo beepo, I guess you can't complain too much about that. 
 
I honestly believe the best aspect of this anime is probably the character, the anime gives a very clear image of the personality of each Anti-Rain and 404 member. 
 
The story....well is there one? Nope, well maybe the M4 in Wonderland scene but that's cryptic for newbies. 
 
Sound is good because, who doesn't like cute Soppo and Beepo sounds? 
 
Overall, I give this series a generous 7/10, I'm sure if a proper anime was made, based on MICA's manga they are currently serializing after the Girl's Frontline story, with a bit of meme and non-chibi character design, I'd probably rate that 10/10

(Source: AniDB)","['Parody', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Once upon a time, if you had come up to me and said that a bunch of Japanese guys made an “anime” entirely using MikuMikuDance starring a bunch of popular female voice actresses pretending to be high school girls who are pretending to be in a non-existent after-school club but are really just doing comedy routines from Japanese variety shows and you told me that this was actually genuinely funny you would have elicited from me an incredulous guffaw followed, perhaps, by a slap on the shoulder and a hearty “come off it, mate.” But, no, Tesagure is that show and incredulous me would have dined on crow.  
 
So, what is Tesagure? Like I said: it’s basically a Japanese variety show masquerading as an episodic, slice-of-life anime. The masquerade is paper thin, of course, and the show indulges often in pointing it out. It’s animated entirely in MikuMikuDance, which is this really awful 3D animation program that is the software equivalent of trying to wrestle a coked-up, greased baboon. If you’ve ever watched stuff on Youtube or NicoNico labelled “MMD” that’s the program: models will clip through each other constantly and the hair meshes just go nuts all the time. So, the fact that these guys were able to make relatively professional-looking, fifteen to twenty-minute episodes with minimal clipping and nothing going insane is grounds for, like, the Nobel Peace Prize. Now, don’t get me wrong, Tesagure looks awful. I mean, it’s made in MMD: you get what you pay for. The textures for the models are simple and probably just stock that came with the software. Be that as it may, I think that lends a lot to Tesagure’s charm. See, it’s supposed to look stupid because it’s a Japanese comedy and Japanese comedy is quintessentially incapable of subtlety. 
 
And that’s the most remarkable thing about Tesagure. The writing is actually funny -- to me, a Westerner. The reason I find this so remarkable is because Japanese people have a hard time dealing with comedy. Partly this is a consequence of culture: being funny isn’t Japanese. Japanese culture is super-serious even when it’s trying not to be. I’m not trying to be racist or bigoted here: I’m positing this on anthropological fact. Moreover, the Japanese language, though in certain areas quite robust, is highly contextual, owing to its Chinese and Sanskrit roots. Quite often, sentences and even certain words have multiple interpretations and everything coming out of Japanese person’s mouth is highly ambiguous, subject to a high degree of misinterpretation, and predicated on a host of tacit assumptions grounded in the cultural paradigm. So, telling a joke in Japanese is really, really hard. The language simply isn’t built for it. Consequently, Japanese people who want to be funny have had to construct ways around this. Their solution, from what I’ve experienced, has been to simply hammer the joke in as hard as physically possible, subtlety be damned. Crack open any gag manga and you’ll probably see one of the characters do a little aside after the joke where they flat-out explain it as obviously as possible -- because they have to, lest the Japanese audience be confused (“I don’t understand. She said ‘I really like you.’ Why did she hit him? Oh, I see, she wasn’t being serious. My language is incapable of denoting sarcasm.”). 
 
Conversely, Tesagure’s jokes somehow come across despite the ponderousness of the language. And I think the main reason why it is so successful is because all of the dialogue is recorded live. That’s why I’ve been calling this a Japanese variety show. The voice actresses are literally in a little sound booth together talking to each other and doing the gags. And it works amazingly well! Moreover, the jokes are ad hoc and done on the spot, just like in Japanese talk shows, so occasionally the girls will break down into giggling fits on the spot or screw up the joke or interrupt with little quips. This gives the dialogue an incredibly life-like quality that really brings the humour to life. They aren’t just reading the gags in typical manga-esque, stone-faced monotone. They are just a bunch of Japanese women goofing around in a sound booth. It makes the comedy more human, more spontaneous and natural. It utterly lacks the artificial quality you’d find in something like an internet 4koma. In the later episodes, the girls will record on location at actual Japanese parks and attractions. The actresses themselves even exclaim how unheard of that is! 
 
One of the seiyuus is a real-life pop idol (I’m not big into J-idols so I don’t know who or care) and all of the other seiyuu have professional vocal careers. Thus, they sing both the opening and ending themes and they are really quite good! The soundtrack to Tesagure is nothing short of godlike and I willingly listen to the OST frequently. In addition to the opening and ending themes, they will occasionally sing other songs which, when translated, are extremely self-deprecating and actually incredibly clever. I would watch this show for the music alone, which puts Tesagure head and shoulders above other comedy anime. 
 
Tesagure is basically the Japanese version of Mystery Science Theatre 3000. They just sit around riffing on anime and manga stereotypes and doing humourous bit gags. And that’s great because it actually works super well. It’s genuinely funny for everyone, not just Japanese people: real John Lennon, hands-joined-across-the-world crap. Man, I hate MikuMikuDance. 


          
 
       Helpful It's a little surprising that one of the most meta and self aware shows in the anime industry could be one that isn't even conventionally animated. Tesagure! Bukatsumono is, at first glance, a horribly CG animated moe slice of life show, otaku-targeted, made simply for the sake of money. Never mind that it has surprisingly high sales for such a low budget production (its second season is currently outselling Kill la Kill); sales only indicate popularity, which never means much about quality anyway. 
 
Or does it? If you look past the CG animation and watch through the first episode, you will discover right away that this is a series filled to brim with anime trope parodies. Its OP sequence goes through, with almost methodical precision, every cut you can expect to see in an anime opening, while the lyrics provide instant narration. ""And now we're running! And now we're reaching out our hands! As long as we keep this up, we'll have a real anime opening in no time!"" Similar parody is seen frequently throughout the series, with topics ranging from anime hair colours, to overly powerful student councils, and even to the way anime schools never seem to have male students. It's always hilarious to see this show pick out, with such unerring accuracy, the little flaws and irregularities of anime that every other series has come to ignore. 
 
The humour extends beyond parodies of the anime medium. Tesagure! describes the activities of the Tesaguri-bu, a club dedicated to letting its members grope for their respective interests. As such, every episode has them discussing a different club activity they could take part in. This opens up into a systematic break-down of activities as they are portrayed in anime and manga, with the characters very wittily pointing out illogical features of each. But it doesn't stop there. The characters spend roughly half of each episode brainstorming ways to improve upon the activity under discussion, each coming up with their own 'New XXX club'. ”新しい”, ""new"", is a word you're going to hearing a lot when you watch this show. The brainstorm segment is generally the highlight of each episode, as the ideas thrown out are deliberately ridiculous and very funny. It's because of this random humour that even people who don't watch a lot of anime can appreciate a lot of the comedy in this show. 
 
As a matter of fact, much of what makes this show funny besides the continually inserted jokes is the characters themselves. The main cast (four of them, and of course all girls) each come off as having distinct personalities and play each other off very well in their separate roles, from Koharu the naive kouhai to Hina the mysterious (and floating) senpai. Cliches they may be, but as a unit they work very well, and their energy alone is enough to make even unfunny jokes crack a laugh. 
 
It is a unique feature of this show's production that allows the characters to interact so realistically and with such energy. While most anime are animated and then dubbed over, Tesagure! has its audio recorded and then the animation made to match. Supposedly, parts of the dialogue are also improvised, resulting in moments when the characters talk over one another or bend double in laughter for seconds on end. These are small details, but they really solidify the character interactions of the show. If you were to watch Tesagure! with your eyes closed, the group of girls joking on your screen might not be just the two dimensional characters seen everywhere else. For once, they could be real people, and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. 
 
Tesagure! is, as a result, one of the truest and most entertaining pure slice of life series in the anime medium. Juggernauts like K-ON! and YuruYuri feature with a good mix of slice of life and drama, and so become as entertaining as they are. For Tesagure! to reach similar heights of entertainment with its far lower production quality and nothing but slice of life should be a testament to how well this show is executed. If there ever comes a day when an English fansub group picks this up and subs it in full, do yourself a favour and watch it. If nothing else, you will be impressed with a very strong sense of the 新しい.

          
 
       Helpful ""Oh no, another CG monstrosity that shames the essence of anime."", is more or less what I thought when came upon Tesagure! Bukatsumono. Why? I don't know, maybe the crude novelty of it all and the delicate standards being broken put me in shock. But from death came life and that's what this anime is.  
 
Tesagure! Bukatsumono is a very meta piece. It shows you the cliches and tropes prevalent in many anime and manga while playing with new(新しい yes, you will hear this a lot) and interesting and lewd and gay and sometimes violent ways things like cute girls falling from the sky, or cute girl running to school bread on mouth, or maybe guys who keep shouting while playing sports, could be different from the norm.  
 
So if you like panic attacks, sliding, bad puns and strange imaginations of Japanese voice actors, give this a go. 
 
And one last bit, this anime is half ad-lib, so that's fun.

       Helpful The K-ON! series has been subject to much debate. Some people felt it was the best lite hearted series to come around in a long time, while others felt it came off a bit too moe and simplistic for its own good. I have to say up front that I really enjoyed the first season of K-ON! It mixed well the music themes with a nice easy to get into story. Unfortunately not so much with these specials though. They are, well, they’re a little thin. 
 
These specials feel exactly like what it says in the title...a special. Being that the episodes only last roughly two to three minutes, fans might be surprised that most of the episodes are split into about 3 parts an episode. Meaning that each skit lasts only about a minute or less. Sometimes they lead into one another, while other times they differ completely from the last scene. The skits remain quite random, and gone is the music theme the series set. Now we see the characters caught up in more random situations. Whether it be Yui thinking random thoughts about the cast, to the band being stranded on a deserted island, to watching them build a snowman in the winter. As expected they are all episodic, and don’t build on anything for the series future. I think the reason I was dissapointed with these, is because they remained a bit too bland in their approach. The situations they are in are not particularly as interesting as you would expect from K-ON!, making these feel more like a side attempt. Now some may argue that these are only 2 minute specials, and that they aren’t suppose to be particularly deep. While this is true, I still feel at the same time it could have been handled better. 
 
Most people will probably hate the art style in these. While I can give them credit that they did stylized the look of K-ON! to some degree, the character design in this is quite poor. The characters are drawn very simplistic, with round hands, and under detailed backgrounds. It looks like something a 2nd grade student would make in their art session. I don’t mind simplicity, but this was a bit too much. 
 
The sound I enjoyed quite a bit in this, which is rightfully so being that the franchise has a music theme. Although there is no opening theme to these, they use tracks for the actual anime, and the ending credits are fast paced and exciting. You even get some catchy bloops and bleeps in the background. The voice acting is also well done, all actresses came back to fill their appropriate roles. They’re cute, charming, and fun to listen to. 
 
Surprisingly, I did feel the characters retained their personalities from the series, which will make these feel very familiar to their fans. Yui and Ui are still sweet, Mio is still as shy as ever, and even Azusa makes appearances here. Really that’s what made up for some of the short comings the specials had, with the actual characters. If you loved them before, I think you will like them in these as well. 
 
Being that these specials are so short, I think fans should check them out. Overall, if you are in fact a hardcore K-ON! fan, then you will get some enjoyment from these. If you aren’t one, then you may want to skip these, and watch the OVA and/or wait for the second season of K-ON! to premiere.

          
 
       Helpful These little specials are basically random short silly storylines, either told by the story or the characters. It does not continue or relate to the season in any way.

19,7295,81,5.306505338,Anime with an ensemble casts,Koi Tsubomi,An animated music video for Oku Hanako's song  Koi Tsubomi .,"['Music', 'Kids', 'Fantasy']","This is my first review, but please bear with me.  
 
 
 
STORY: 8/10 
 
Koi Tsubomi is an animated short that is essentially aimed at a younger audience much like the other Minna no Uta shorts. However, this one in particular utilizes the song ""Koi Tsubomi"" by Oku Hanako, and much like the other Minna no Uta shorts, it focuses on telling the story without too much depth. It's pretty straightforward, and it's about a young girl and a polar bear whom become separated, and their emotional attachment to one another. This short focuses on the thoughts of having to leave a loved one, and although it might be odd to see a child and a polar bear missing each other, the lyrics of the song combined with the overall art style really made this short stick out above some of the other shorts. Personally, I didn't think the story was too deep, and it didn't make me think, but considering that this short is aimed at a younger audience, I think this short did a phenomenal job at explaining the emotions or struggles of leaving another person dear to you.  
 
ART: 8/10  
 
The art was very cute, and definitely attractive to people of all ages, but it was by no means something that can be thought of as first-class art. That having been said, there are scenes such as the polar bear's growling while shivering due to what I would expect to be sadness, and just the tiny details like those that make this short animation more appealing to the eyes.  
 
SOUND: 10/10  
 
I'm a fan of Oku Hanako, so that might have something to due with my attachment to the song, but putting my bias aside, the lyrics are extremely deep. There aren't any sound effects since it's essentially just a music video, but the lyrics are what make this song that much more interesting. The words are extremely straightforward much like the art of the video, and Oku Hanako's voice fit extremely well with the mood as well.  
 
CHARACTER: 10/10 
 
Although you can't normally see that much character development within music videos or animated shorts, this one was different. People might disagree with me when I say that this had an interesting character development, but that's honestly what I personally think. Why? Because within the short amount of time, you could see the characters' attachment to one another, and how both the girl and the polar bear go from hiding their sadness from one another to outright showing their longing for the other later on in the video. Also, although the lyrics speak about ""love"", the animators decided to use a young girl and a bear, and that alone is already quite unique for what you'd call conventional ""love"". The polar bear displayed emotions that normal animals would not show, and that alone makes this an interesting watch.  
 
ENJOYMENT: 9/10  
 
As you might be able to guess by now, I absolutely loved this particular animated short. I've watched many different Minna no Uta shorts, and other animated shorts as well, but this one in particular made me almost tear up because the combination between the music and the characters, as well as the manner the art was utilized was absolutely phenomenal. If people are to get into animated shorts, this is definitely a must-watch.  
 
OVERALL: 9/10  
 
The only reason I would not give this a 10/10 is because of multiple things--mainly, the story and the art could definitely be more detailed. That having been said, this is a stunning animated short, and the song is endearing as well. I can watch this over and over and still not get tired of it! I recommend this to people whom are interested in animated shorts overall.

Story 
At first i was lost to what was the content was. It wasn't until the end that i put two and two together. We all take journeys in our life. Events that can leave an impacting stand on, mainly vacations. My take on the message is while you can't live where you want to at the precise moment having been there at least you have memories. As long as you hold onto that sacred bond it will be as if you never left. A true romance and uplifting piece that is told in a somewhat sad tone. 
 
Art 
'bears'(inside joke) a strong resemblance to anime Gambo. Was that intentional or intentional? I will leave to you. Regardless of the verdict art portrayed the right picture. Two different worlds were shown. One world was sunny while the other was cold. One had a big creature, the other a small human. Yet, the connection felt so close to each other. 
 
On a different note. I really enjoyed the Japanese subtitles for the lyrics. Not only could one see the words being sung but with the use of a beat note(a guide arrow) made singing along kind of fun.

19,13859,82,5.306505338,Anime with an ensemble casts,Accel World: Acchel World.,Spin-off of  Accel World  included on the anime Blu-ray/DVDs.,"['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy']","Dear reader, 
 
I recently finished watching the first Accel World series and Accel World EX. I really liked the EX specials, so I decided to move on to the other specialseries based on Accel World: Accel World Specials. However, I dropped Accel World Specials after watching just 2 episodes. Why you ask? I'll explain. 
 
First of all, the artwork. As many of you know, Accel World is nicely animated and has a huge variation of colours and drawstiles gathered within it (good visible when watching in HD). The 2 Accel World EX episodes were made the same way. 
However, Accel World Specials is drawn in a way that you would expect to find in an American cartoonserie for people aged between 4 and 6. It's completely ruines the artwork reputation the original Accel World series has.  
 
Second, the storyline. Except for the characters and some basics from the Accel World series, it has nearly nothing to do with the original series. these 'Accel World Specials' follow a complete different storyline, and to my opinion it's also a very dumb storyline. Especially someone who just finished watching Accel World I'd strongly recommend NOT to watch Accel World Specials. It will completely ruin your idea of the Accel World Universe. 
 
And when we are speaking about the worse points in these series, lets not forget the characters. Even due most voice actors (in the japanese spoken version) seem to be the same, the scriptwriter sertainly isn't. The characters are doing things the characters in the real Accel World series would never do. Their feelings and characters are also completely messed up. Even due every special in this epic storyline is just a couple of minutes long, the characters will drive most of the Accel World fans crazy (in a negative way).  
 
Lets see.... Is there anything I forgot? Oh yeah, the enjoyment.  
People with lame humour and no sence of good artwork and storyline (not ment in an offending way) will probably enjoy Accel World Specials. Any other person, especially those that have seen Accel World and/or know something about anime, will almost sertainly drop these series after just 1 or 2 episodes. 
 
 
Overal it's one of the worst anime specials I've ever seen.  
However, I do recomment you guys to watch at least 1 episode of it. Not because it's fun, but because then you will probably perfectly understand what I'm talking about in this review.

          
 
       Helpful Episodes 2-7 need a warning label: You CANNOT Unwatch 
 
Specials are often comical imitations of the real show, and I don't think anybody typically has an objection to that. Occasionally it is nice to have some light-hearted humor after a particularly deep or ""heavy"" series.  
 
To be honest, though, it didn't work here. Perhaps, the largest reason it didn't work was a result of the way they began the specials. The first episode was full-length and had anything you would have come to expect from the Accel World series, albeit almost entirely detached from the main plot-line. It wasn't especially good but definitely met the standards of the original series, and I would have enjoyed the rest more if it had continued that way. 
 
But then, for some strange reason, the creators decided to take what could have been a fulfilling group of sequels to Accel World and turn it into an ugly amalgamation of poor humor and characterization. I'm not an expert on anime (far from it), but I personally think it's a bit stupid to switch to ""children's book animation"" (because I don't know the damn word for the art style) when you've laid groundwork for a solid set of episodes. 
 
Considering this is likely the last thing we see of Accel World, I'm extremely disappointed that the high-tension, extremely emotional chaos will be replaced by cutesy crap forever in my mind. What aggravated me the most was Lotus/Hime's portrayal as being both arrogant and fairly stupid. Anybody who saw the original series knows that Black Lotus is perhaps the most epic character. How a writer could sit and replace that perfectly seductive yet shy, wise yet absent-minded, and stubborn yet humble girl with such a gross parody will forever amaze me.

          
 
       Helpful This special of accel world was very dissapointing, i waited it to have some real action in it and good animation as the anime itself had. I watched the whole 8 epiosdes just 'cause they were so short and i had nothing to do at that time and i must say, this special was made 100% with humor and had nothing to do wit the main plot from the anime. I wouldnt say this is the worst thing ever but i prefer not to watch this if you dont like chibi cartooney things. But if you actually like a little bit childish humor and chibis you could watch this.

Then the small Tower of Bavel was completed on a page. Looking into the tower, they found an old man sitting and reading a book, surrounded by innumerable books. As the man turned pages, mythical animals appeared and disappeared. 
 
(Source: yamamura-animation.jp)",['Kids'],"Bavel's Book is a 1996 TV special by independent director and animator Koji Yamamura that tells about two siblings who find a mysterious book left on a bench and what happens to them after they start reading it. For its five-minute length, the anime presents a simple yet interesting story that comprises: 
- a short adventure with a twist; 
- a fair bit of surrealism that involves merging our reality with the reality inside the book; 
- and also a cultural reference to Jorge Luis Borges - a famous Argentinian writer who is widely considered one of the key figures in the magical realism genre. 
In general, with this short Yamamura vividly portrays how a person may get completely absorbed while reading an engaging book, especially if that person is a child with a rich imagination. The story may be not something mind-blowing, yet it's good for the fact that it employs an interesting surreal concept; brings enough twists for its brief duration; pays tribute to Borges and literature in general; and with all that remains clear and absolutely unpretentious, so that even a child could understand it. 
Speaking of the animation, it is somewhat of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is very interesting, creative and original, just like in all Yamamura's works. On the other hand, it also has a fairly low-budget look, and Yamamura's art style, with its brownish colours, sloppy lines and somewhat grotesque character designs, may probably not appeal to some viewers. In other words, it is artistic but low-budget and perhaps not for everyone. 
Speaking of the sound department, the soundtrack is several short avant-garde tunes performed by a female duo called Syzygys. The melodies employ keyboards and violin; they aren't particularly memorable, yet they sound nice and fit various situations in the anime quite well. As for the voice-acting, it's just decent: the characters don't talk much, and when they talk, they sound just like usual kids should. 
As for the characters themselves, they are just a boy, his sister, a certain man and a certain creature they encounter on their adventure. None of them get any substantial characterization; however, that's not what this short is supposed to do, and it hardly makes any sense to expect deep personalities and development in the course of five minutes anyway. So, the cast is nothing much, but that's excused by the show's format. 
Overall, this anime is recommended to Yamamura's fans and those who are generally into experimental animation and unusual stories. Also, if you enjoy Bavel's Book, I highly recommend Atama Yama - my favourite Yamamura's short with a similar theme of merging realities, albeit in a totally different story.

A story about stories. Portrayed to the audience that can get the most rewards that being children. Growing up is annoying. There are a lot of things to learn. Most of which can be tragic. Reading used to be a method of escape. With words clever use of depiction of images allowed one for at least a brief moment to put aside one's matters and escape into the dream before them. Sadly the era of televisions/computers changed that dream. Only time will tell if that was for the better or worse in terms of knowledge/benefits. I personally find this modern area to be neutral. Mainly because i am some what numb to the negative aspects. That being trolls and vile poisoners to name a few. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying positive feedback from other users around the world that enjoyed the same book or show.  
 
What i think would be a killer idea is if a sequel was done that showed the modern era of technology. Would the children still feel the same? 
 
Only aspect i didn't like was the artwork. For me i found it to be a tad blurry probably due to what i perceived to be water color. Which has a tendency of smearing color. That and the character's feet look abnormal which prevented me from fully appreciated anything else during those moments. 
 
One aspect i did like was the amount of psychology portrayed in that brief film. Such as was the book left on purpose as a mere test for younger minds? Was the book a book or a diary/thought journal?

19,1812,84,5.302026666,Anime with an ensemble casts,Hanoka,"This anime is the first full-fledged TV anime made with FLASH. 
 
The story takes place on a planet Tokinea where human beings and Star Races have been fighting. The story revolves around a girl who was made as ""Demon God,"" an ultimate weapon against human beings, and a boy who is a partner of the girl. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)",['Sci-Fi'],"Hanoka is a series that proudly proclaims that it was the first TV anime series ever made solely using flash animation. And it's a mess! For starters, the animation is incredibly inconsistent and looks really jarring and awkward most of the time with action sequences that lack any kind of flow and having character designs that look off model most of the time. Now, considering the year this show came out in and if it were an independent project produced by one guy I would give it a pass. It was made during the Newgrounds era when many talented animators were beginning to emerge in the case of Egoraptor and the Eddsworld series. Eddsworld, in particular, was around two years into it's run when this show came out and the flash animation there, which was produced by one guy, is still a ton better and more consistent than this piece of aids. You could argue that it was the best the staff were capable of at the time with flash so therefore this holds no water but it still doesn't make the show any less visually unappealing or better. How the hell this got approved for television is way beyond me, even more so when it aired in 2006, a year that is considered to be one of the greatest years in anime as a whole which makes this piece of trash feel even more trite. 
 
Even if the animation were good it still wouldn't have made any difference since the script is bad. While it is MUCH more consistent in its writing than the previous shows I have reviewed thus far and actually does make coherent sense it's still nothing to write home about. The narrative is as cliche as they come revolving around a war between humans and ferocious alien monsters. In order to battle against these creatures, humans have developed super-humans to fight against these aliens and the series focuses on one of these super-humans called Hanako. The rest of the show is a series of different missions and the such involving Hanoka and her partner and that's pretty much it. The plot never develops and explores any deeper themes, the characters don't go through any arcs and the story remains stagnant throughout. It spews out some of the most generic liners too ranging from ""I'll do anything to protect you"" to ""He is my world"". This is something you have seen before on a much better level somewhere else and I always cringe at the delivery of lines of this nature. 
 
Each episode is only about three minutes in length which works terribly against the show's narrative since it is not given nearly enough time to properly flesh out characters and the setting. The aliens are generic in design and are even less memorable than the Gastrea in Black Bullet and the fights feel disjointed and boring leading up to an AWFUL conclusion. They do hint at the theme of discrimination between the people like Hanoka and the regular humans but it comes across as forced and forgettable as there is no time invested in this idea and comes across as victimising just for the sake of victimising. Hanoka herself is such a bland and boring character that I would have forgotten who she even was if the title of the series didn't share her name.  
 
The thing about this show is that it's just so boring. It's nowhere near as bad as Dark Cat mind you but it's also nowhere near the absurd levels of Genocyber. The show is as interesting as watching a guy cut his own fingernails. There is nothing to care for nor get too angry about either. Hanoka is just a 'thing'. It's bad, sure, but doesn't leave you with anything by the time you're done watching it. Should I praise it for being able to end without me wanting to kill myself or critique it for being so lazy and forgettable?  It's hard to pinpoint what the aim of this anime was and just what the hell it was trying to achieve but when you get down to it, it's a pile of trash.

       Helpful Terrible! I tried to find the worst anime I could to see just how bad it could get, and I ""wasn't disappointed"". 
 
I watched the first three episodes and loathed every moment. I was constantly tempted to stop. Eventually I got sick of it and watched the last episode to see how it ended. It took all of 30 seconds to figure out what happened between episode 3 and episode 12 the writing was so predictable. The series skipped over fight scenes frequently, even at the climax (if you can call it that). 
 
The visuals of this series are awful and made me just want to close my eyes. The animation is at best wonky. Even the characters' facial expressions look weird. 
 
The best part of this was its music which was at best an average experience. The voice acting was okay and the sound effects were listenable. Nothing fancy here. 
 
The characters were boring and irritating. Most of them were clichés with nothing that stood out. They all lacked any interest and despite attempts at building some back story I couldn't care less about these characters. 
 
This anime is not enjoyable! It's eye and brain torture... Show it to your most hated enemies and they might just claw their own eyes out. 
 
Overall this show is very difficult to watch and has little reason to exist. If you like challenging games just try and watch it the whole way through.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Honestly? The story isn't terrible. It's very basic, simple, and not even attempting to bring anything new to the table, but there's a vague understanding of general pacing, structure, foreshadowing, and other basic traits of writing. In fact, in the right hands, this narrative has the potential to become something very likable. Patricians will consider it drawl regardless of the form it takes, but that doesn't denounce the fact that this definitely has a ladder it could climb. 
 
That said, in regards to what keeps this from being all that great, the problem is the lifeless leads. There isn't enough time to really spend creating any character for them, and for the most part, things do come together to create believable characters, but it's still not enough to save it. For instance, most short 3-5 minute anime's forsake any form of characterization and just stick to comedy. Others that try and be serious (see: Pupa) fail because there isn't enough time to build anything believable. That said, this story definitely tries, and in some regards, succeeds. 
 
That said, the fact that the time is so short, the characters are borderline middle-school fanfiction tier, and unoriginal premise, the story itself is not all that memorable. 
 
Which leads me to the memorable part of this anime... 
 
 
Art: 
Hot damn, is the animation weak. There are a lot of decent flash animations out there, and this is not one of them. The only reason I don't have this as a 1/10 is because there are some cool sequences. Outside of those 2 scenes, everything is a mess. It's good that it never becomes unfollowable, but it's still not very pretty to look at. 
 
 
Sound: 
I really liked the soundtrack. I somewhat wish this was a longer anime so that we could have some more excellent music tracks to harvest from this mess of a production. Only once did I feel the music was used poorly, but everywhere else sounded pretty excellent. 
 
VA work is pretty good. If the characters were better, I think some of the performances could have moved me, but it's such a barren product that it's a pipe-dream to think anything like that could happen. 
 
 
Character: 
There's an attempt at characterization. That said, there is something to appreciate in Hanoka when it comes to how inept the writing is. It's like someone consumed so much media that they chose to regurgitate all the necessary bullet points when it comes to telling a story. 
 
Nobody is really likable, but I didn't find myself liking anyone. My biggest issue is with how OP Hanoka is. Everything else was fine, but it wasn't ever mind-blowing. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
I actually kind of enjoyed this. It was fun. A harmless production that, in the right hands, could be a lot better. The biggest issue here is the animation, but everything else is fairly simple and elementary (save the soundtrack. That was surprisingly impressive.)

The season will run within the 30-minute Ultra Super Anime Time block beginning on July 3, 2015. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","The Japanese T-Pain is back! Miss Monochromosome returns to bring us longer episodes! More songs! More rope to hang ourselves with! Yet despite my trepidation at returning to a short that I hadn't enjoyed previously, it seems something happened in the last two years that means this Miss Monochrome was actually a somewhat enjoyable watch (maybe it was the GF:Beta cameo? Maybe not). 
 
Season two of Miss Monochrome picks up where 2013's story left off. Left penniless after being conned by Mana-chan out of her fortune, Miss Monochrome now lives in a tiny, tumbledown room with a newspaper bed with only her charging station, her job at the convenience store & her faithful robovac Ruu-chan left. But those setbacks clearly haven't put a dent in her determination to pursue her dream of becoming a top idol, so she's back on her feet with a plan to make an album & go on tour. If only she knew where to start. 
 
The changes between season one & two of Miss Monochrome are pretty much all for the better. The story this season has a much more relaxed pace than in season one, which struggled with its shorter run time & less focused story to feel like more than something stuck in front of a music video promo. The longer length of each episode means that each story has more time to be setup & carried through, & since most of the characters in season one return to season two it means less time is needed for character introductions. It's also clear even before the announcement of season 3 that season two really shouldn't be viewed as a complete story in itself, which explains why its climactic episode feels like a mid-season finale rather than an actual ending. 
 
The humour also seems to have improved noticeably. References are given more weight than just a passing quote or remark, & some episodes indulge in some particularly absurd scenarios. My personal favourite was when Miss Monochrome is briefly whisked away on a whirlwind romance - sorry, ""friendship""- by a giant battery (Shocking, isn't it?) There are some atrocious puns (promoter...pro-motorist...Initial D reference opportunity!) & it does suffer the usual anime problem of repeating a joke ad nauseum, though.  
 
The returning characters are all more or less as they were. Maneo continues to be Miss Monochrome's well meaning but not all that helpful boss & manager. Mana shows up now & then to remind everyone that she's happy to help when the opportunity to defraud presents itself. Kikuko is there to offer encouragement when her & Miss Monochrome's paths cross, & Ruu-chan continues to be the little robovac that could. The only noticeable change to the existing characters is Miss Monochrome seems to have learned sarcasm between season one & now, but not how to express it in a way others can pick up on it. This ties in with the main new character introduced to the show, Yayoi, who is a gullible klutz that will all too eagerly rush out to do whatever ridiculous thing Miss Monochrome tasks her with. The other main addition is Akiko, a coworker at the convenience who can also play a wicked guitar riff. Overall they're an enjoyable bunch to watch, though Yayoi's insistence of saying ""I'm such a klutz"" every episode gets annoying pretty fast. 
 
It would be amiss to talk about Miss Monochrome without mentioning the music, since that's what it's really all about. I won't pretend to be a fan of what's normally considered idol or vocaloid music, so I wouldn't say any of it was particularly enjoyable. However, it all seemed okay for what it is & the OP in particular had some charm to it that meant I didn't skip it after the first listen. The same can't be said for the ED, though. Not because of the song, which was alright for what it was. However, the ED sees the return of the 3D Monochrome performing a mocapped dance routine & it's even more the stuff of nightmares than last time. The mocap is good enough that the body moves like an actual person, which makes Miss Monochrome's oversize anime head bobbling about on top of her shoulders look like something out of a horror film. 
 
Much to my surprise, Miss Chromosome 2 turned out to not only be an improvement on season one, but actually rather enjoyable to someone who didn't really like it previously. It's not without its problems, but it has it's charm & the focus of lighthearted comedy rather than the usual teen melodrama that usually makes up idol stories is a refreshing change. Will have to wait & see if season three continues this, but for now Miss Chromosome 2 is a enjoyable first half & a notable improvement on what came before.

          
 
       Helpful To kick things off, I presume that you - the person reading this - has watched the first season of Miss Monochrome: The Animation. In that case I,ll get straight to business.  
 
Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 continues the story of Miss Monochrome, Maneo manager and Ruu-chan. Each episode focuses on one of the aspects of super idol life, like touring, fanbases, merchandise and so forth, much like the first season.  
 
Each episode lasts longer than last season, allowing for better plots for the individual episodes. The show is as light-hearted and funny as ever, and all in all I'd like to say that Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 does what the first season did, but even better :D  
 
An enjoyable watch!  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I was certainly glad to hear that there was a second season coming out for Miss Monochrome. Now that I have watched it, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed.  
 
For those who don’t know the story of Miss Monochrome, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 is a continuation of the first season, Miss Monochrome: The Animation. Our main character, Miss Monochrome, wants to stand out and become a famous idol. Although she has taken a few steps to become one, she doesn’t know what else to do from there. As a result, she decides to make her first album and go on tour.  
 
The pacing in this anime is somewhat slow as the episodes carry on with its story. With that being said, the story progresses much more. Something that should be noted, before you watch this, is that it builds its suspense off of the first season. If you watch this alone, you might not feel the same suspense as for the people who watched the first one. I advise that you watch the first season before you watch this. The thing that interested me the most about Miss Monochrome was its ridiculous, over-the-top comedy. While Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 pertains some of that over-the-top comedy, it doesn’t hold that same amount as the first season.  
 
Needless to say, the art style of Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 is very reminiscent of the first one. The atmosphere is upbeat, light, and the character designs are unique as always. However, the upbeat atmosphere sort of counteracts with Miss Monochrome’s sense of humor making the anime seem a bit of a mess. There is also a bit of 3D CGI included, but only at the ending theme song like the first season.  
 
Moreover, the characters are the same except that Miss Monochrome has developed a sense of humor and a bit of a selfish personality. For example, she is more sarcastic in this than the first season. Being the android that Miss Monochrome is, she doesn’t know when to use sarcasm properly. While some may find this humorous, others may find this to be off-putting as the same jokes are repetitively used. Speaking of sarcasm, when Yayoi Konno, a new character that wasn’t seen before in the first season, takes what Miss Monochrome says to heart, she creates a larger than life situation which usually results for the worse. Expanding on a few characters I mentioned, some additions include Akiko, a talented guitarists who is conveniently an employee at the store where the main characters work at, Yayoi Konno, Miss Monochrome’s promoter who is a bit of a klutz and overambitious about the work she does, and there’s an idol group called Caramel, but I won’t go into too much detail about them.  
 
Surprisingly, all of the voice actors and actresses have returned except with a few new additions. If you didn’t know, Ruu-chan has gotten a voice actor. Unfortunately, he doesn’t speak as much as I hoped for, but nonetheless, he was still fun to hear. Akiko and Yayoi were also fun to hear, I thought they were a great addition to the show as they seem to create fun moments. For those who wanted an opening in the first season, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 has added a theme song called Black or White which is about one minute long. Also, the ending theme song is called Step by Step which is about two minutes long and mocapped with a 3D CGI version of Miss Monochrome which is similar to the first season’s ending. Both songs are sung by Miss Monochrome; if you’re a fan of VOCALOID, you might like the way she sounds. To me, the opening and ending theme songs sounded all right, I did not hate it nor did I like it. 
  
Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2 does make references to other shows here and there, incorporating it into the story which indeed make it funnier. It also references jokes back to the first season. However, the only issue I had with this anime was that it didn’t seem to have the same amount of humor like the first season. Some episodes were funnier than the others and other episodes felt stale. Like I said before, it felt like it was more plot driven and climactic. 
 
If you want to get a better understanding of the comedy and story, it is advised to watch the first season. On the other hand, if you want to understand the references they make, note that this is not required to make it more enjoyable but you might want to check out a few other animes such as Initial D, Golden Time, and Wooser no Sono Higurashi. Miss Monochrome: The Animation 2’s humor pertains some of its unexpected funny moments, however, it is not as random as it was in the first season. Unfortunately, the show sets up for a third season. Hopefully, we will see Miss Monochrome become a popular idol. I look forward to watching the third season.

In a world where the taste and texture of food is extremely important, there exist individuals known as Bishoku-ya (luxury food providers) who specialize in the acquisition of rare ingredients and animals. Toriko is one of these hunters and it is his dream to find the most precious foods in the world and create the ultimate dinner course. As one of the most skilled hunters in the world he is regularly hired by restaurants and the rich to seek out new ingredients and rare animals. 
 
A man with inhuman ability, he utilizes his incredible strength and knowledge of the animal kingdom to capture ferocious, evasive and rare beasts to further his final goal, the ultimate dinner course composed of the most delicious food in the world. He is currently accompanied by a weak and timid chef who, inspired by Toriko's ambition, travels with him to improve his culinary skills and find rare ingredients.","['Action', 'Super Power', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Shounen']","As a pilot for a series it's good, but like most episode pilots there's a reason why it remains as a stand alone feature. If you're already familiar with the concept of Toriko then there's no need to explain the premise as this review covers the differences in adaptations. 
 
The story basically covers chapter 1 & 2 of the Toriko manga which is the Garragator encounter & being the first ever animated work of the series. Key differences include the usage of blood & animation performed by UFO Table (Fate/Zero). Aside from changes in voice actors & music, this pilot is very similar to its manga content. 
 
Pilots usually serve as a rough draft with what the anime should more or less be, however in this case there was no anime to come from it at least not within the following year. This pilot was made in 2009 & it wasn't until 2011 where Toei began to adapt the series. While the tone featured in the pilot was a lot closer to it's manga, many fans ask ""Why wasn't the anime done by UFO Table?"" or ""Why was the anime so watered down?"" 
 
I can only speculate on these questions with no real evidence to back up my claims, however I believe there's a very simple answer as to why Toriko didn't get animated by UFO Table. For starters noticed how there's a gap in between the pilot & the anime debut being 3 years as opposed to other pilots such as Hunter X Hunter & One Piece who had animes within a year of their pilot debut. One of the reasons may have been UFO Table still being relatively small at the time but the more concrete answer would be the manga as I feel the pilot simply served as gateway into purchasing the graphic novels. The biggest reason why i believe in this, is the amount of content that the manga had. When the pilot debuted, the Toriko manga only had an estimated 50 chapters (till the end of the Regal Mammoth Arc), thus meaning not much would be adapted. If anything, Toriko may have been a 13 episode series or luckily 26 seeing how Toei covers those chapters within 17 episodes. Another guess is that no company was willing to take a risk into adapting a manga that's been published for a year. Seeing how it was 2009, most mangas didn't usually get immediate treatment as opposed to now in 2014. 
 
Overall, the pilot is okay feature where we see Toriko being gritty. Lastly,it's usually a common practice where animes aren't drawn by the same company who drew their pilots or contain various differences in the final product. Take HxH for example as the pilot was animated by Studio Pierrot while the anime is done Nippon Animation. 

          
 
       Helpful Man oh man, after watching this I still don't know why we don't have a proper tv series with this. Wondering if you should watch it? Keep reading, I'll be sure to try and convince you! 
 
When trying to explain the story, it's tricky. ""It's a guy hunting monsters for food"" doesn't even come close. The best way to describe it is ""Monster Hunter without weapons, where they eat the monster afterwards!"" 
This is so original. It's difficult to explain unless you watch it, so take it from me: every chapter is cooler than the last. 
 
The art here is amazing. The shading, colouring, action scenes and the blood flowing: beautiful! 
 
The sound is good as well. There are three speaking roles, and all the voices sound believable. The music is good, it really fits the mood. Wether it's action, traveling or, naturally, eating. 
 
The characters are awesome. Especially Toriko. Everybody has their own part to play: not everybody can be strong and tough. Komatsu may come across as annoying at parts, but seeing as this is the first episode (here's hoping for more) you should give him time to develop. 
 
The enjoyment is very high. I can't explain it fully, but Toriko is amazing. If the original story, beautiful art, good music and voice acting and original characters aren't good enough for you: I wouldn't know what is! 
 
After you watch this episode, watch the manga :) It really is worth it!

          
 
       Helpful Toriko is a new manga from Shonen Jump about Gourmet Hunters and has become a huge success in Japan. The manga will begin here in the states this June and after reading the first three chapters through Shonen Jump Magazine, all I can say is that I'm really looking forward to reading more. Before the t.v. series begins, the pilot episode was shown at the Jump Super Anime Tour last Christmas and can be seen on youtube, and here's what I have to say about it. 
 
The plot is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga. The story of the pilot is about a famous gourmet hunter named Toriko who has been hired by a timid head chef named Komatsu to obtain a creature known as a Garara Gator for an upcoming festival. Toriko accepts and he departs, with Komatsu coming along in an attempt to see how Toriko succeeds. As I said before this is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga so don't expect too much, but it atleast does a fine job setting up what to expect in the t.v. series. However I felt the manga did a better job explaining Toriko's mission than this pilot did. 
 
Once again, since this is on the first two chapters, so not many characters appear (though a few of the other main characters from the manga appear in the credits), so I'll just review the two main characters. Toriko as an excellent protagonist and is instantly likable from the start.  His carefree and courageous personality does make the character shine. Komatsu is your standard side kick character, but from what I've heard, he develops quite well throughout the course of the manga. 
 
The art and animation are pretty good. The coloring is great and the detail is excellent for a pilot. 
 
The voice acting, while little, is quite good. Takashi Kondo, who is best known for voices like Train from Black Cat and Faust from the Guilty Gear series suited Torko perfectly, and Daisuke Kishio also did an excellent job as Komatsu. Kenjiro Tsude (known for voices like Kaiba from Yu-gi-oh and Mifune from Soul Eater), who voices the boat man Tom also did a good performance despite what little dialogue he has. The music also captures the mood of each scene very well and the ending (which I can't find the name of) is jamming and very catchy. 
 
Overall I found the Toriko pilot to be quite good. It's an excellent way to get you interested in the series and it does a good job setting up for the upcoming t.v. series. Just make sure the video quality of your computer is good enough to see the fight scene. The Toriko pilot gets an 8 out of 10.

       Helpful Okay, I don’t even know where to start with this work of art. “Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi” - or in English referred to, “Spirited Away”, honestly swept me off of my feet. Before I go on though, I’d like to address one thing. This is in fact my review, and my opinion towards this anime. I’m only speaking for myself as everyone has their own thoughts. None are “better” or “more legitimate” than others.  
 
Starting this off, I’m not going to lie, I saw this anime movie feature when it first came out. I was a child back then, and this film managed to scare me. However, recently I decided to revisit this due to high recommendation of a friend. Never would I have ever guessed that this film would rank so high on my list. Being a child that was easily frightened, the unique animation had sent chills down my spine… but with age, I’ve came to enjoy the plot and characters within this series.  
 
First, let’s go over the basic plot of this anime. It might seem stereotypical, but this anime introduces the idea of a young girl stumbling into a magical and unheard of world. However, despite previous adaptations of this simplistic idea, Studio Ghibli brought something fresh and interesting to the table. We’re brought into a world featuring a bathhouse for spirits, complex characters, and blooming romance. For those who don’t find amusement in the romance genre, don’t fret. It’s not a major thing in the plot considering that the main character is ten, whoever, it does introduce the power of ‘true love’. With that essential power at their disposal, our protagonist learns how to work with this world to save her parents and to escape in the meanwhile.  
 
Next- let’s jump into the characters. The first thing I’d like to announce is that the characters are in no way bland. Each person has their own personality, appearance, and importance in this. Character reliability is also put into play here. Our main character, Chihiro, is at first terrified by this whole experience. However, with the help of Haku (a strange boy who aids her in her search to go back home), she’s introduced into the basic lore of this world. Along the way she meets a series of foes and friends who she later learns to get along with. They bond, and over a period of time she becomes content with these spirits. The characters all play important parts in Chihiro’s journey even if it’s a faceless spirit, a huge baby, or a dancing light post. I don’t know if it was only me, but I loved being introduced into the different types of characters in Spirited Away.  
 
Okay, now onto the more technical parts of this anime ; the anime and sound qualities. The animation is pretty good, as it’s not that straining to watch. I don’t have much to compare it to, but definitely it gets the job done beautifully. The sound quality was good, as they gave distinguished noises to multiple things.  
 
Now to wrap this up. I highly enjoyed this feature. Hands down, I recommend this to both anime fans and not. It’s a good movie, and it DEFINITELY deserves the high rating it has on MAL . Even though it might not be for everyone, a bigger half of anime fans mark this film as one of their favorites. And after watching this, I can definitely understand why. 

          
 
       Helpful This was such an amazing movie, one of Ghibli's and Hayao Miyazaki's best works. I would highly recommend this movie if you want something wholesome that still engages you with action the whole way through. Spirited Away, or should I say Blew Me Away, is cute and fun all the way through and all of the characters are loveable in their own unique ways. Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi is a must-watch for all Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki fans. At some parts, the sound was a bit off but it is an old film - you cannot tell it's age with ease either.

 So this is the first all-out seiyuu anime that I have seen. Airing in 2006 in Japan only, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into. I originally wanted to watch this because of the title Love Get Chu….. and the OP that I found. It was enough to make me go “Hmmm, yes this might be fun”. 
 
Love Get Chu is about a group of girls trying to become seiyuu (voice actors/actresses). It’s a very coming of age, slice of life, comedy type of anime. The girls that we’re introduced to are not experts; rather, we watch them become seiyuu from the very beginning, training school. The girls themselves are pretty great, they’re all very different personality wise, but they’re also full of clichés, so if you hate that, this probably isn’t for you right off the bat. We have our super Main girl, the star of the show, the airhead who’s entirely naïve, the natural klutz and the one who is always ready to cheer everyone up; Momoko Ichihara. We also have the shy, quiet and reserved girl Rinka Suzuki, the tomboy Tsubasa Onodera, the observing intelligent girl Amane Oohara and the childhood friend Yurika Sasaki. 
 
 There is also a male lead, the guy who is a part of a love triangle, the one who wants to become an animator, the filler; Atari Maeda. I call him filler because he’s honestly not needed for Love Get Chu. Most of the time he’s just sort of “there”. Sure there are episodes where he helps Momoko get to know herself better or where Momoko can rely on him sometimes, but by the end of the 25th episode, I was rather tired of seeing him. He’s the childhood friend to Yurika and the love triangle involved Yurika, Momoko and himself. 
 
 The story in Love Get Chu is that of what I imagine other seiyuu like anime are, but since this is my first time watching one, I have no direct comparison. I think the biggest issue Love Get Chu has is identity. It starts off as a “we’re going to become seiyuu” and “we’re all rivals” sort of thing. Of course by episode 5, they all become seiyuu and the anime takes a turn for the hardships that are included to become one and the difficulty it is to be a really good seiyuu. It then goes into idol territory and tries to bring up some sort of antagonist; at least that’s what it looked like. I can’t even remember his name; I swear his name is only said like 10 times or something. There are these business and political aspects to Love Get Chu which just show up for seemingly no reason at all. If the entire anime had focused on either becoming a seiyuu, idol, or a combination of both, instead of shoehorning romantic elements and some fake antagonist, I’d give it an 8 or more. 
 
 It’s a little funny, thinking about the way Love Get Chu started and ended, they could be considered different genres really. The beginning has all this great work, lovely animation, great face reactions, super funny scenes and antics between the girls. A little further than halfway through and despair and sad things start to happen, of course it doesn’t last long at all, but my problem is “why”? Why bother having it if you’re not going to expand upon it. Same with the romance elements and things. I’d actually have preferred it if Yurika won Atari; her tactics were slimy and really bad, she took advantage of Atari being drunk and not remembering anything to make him hers. Things like that, which when typed out (and watched too) is 100% dark when compared to the Love Get Chu I watched in the beginning. Like I said, I think Love Get Chu had an identity crisis and just couldn’t figure out how to make 25 episodes of worthwhile content; would have been better off being 1 cour. 
 
 Art style, depending on how you look at it, could be considered bad or good. Airing in 06, most people would expect something nicer to watch, but I actually liked the very early animated art style. It’s cute, the eyes are extra big, the mouths can get crazy wide and faces are different. The entire aesthetic looks really pretty and the outfits the girls wear, oh my goodness, super cute stuff. If there is one part of the show that I really really liked, it’s the art style, the beautiful bright colors, the clothing, the way the world looks; I loved watching Love Get Chu, that’s for sure. 
 
 Sound and things: An anime with a huge focus on seiyuu, so the best thing is how different each seiyuu can sound. There is one specific episode that really highlights the powers of a veteran seiyuu, I won’t spoil it, but being able to do 5 different sounding people, that was really cool to listen to. BGM is very normal and nothing to praise, except for when the sadder things start to happen, the change in both tempo and expected music is very stark and different. OP and ED are pretty amazing. The OP is what made me want to watch Love Get Chu, it’s cheerful, it’s super happy and the animation to go along with it is fantastic. The ED, which took a little bit to warm up to, is what I would say J-Hip/hop or something; once the beats drop and the vocals kick in is when the ED shines and makes it good to listen to. It’s also accompanied by Usumaru, Momoko’s keychain mascot usagi doll who dances on screen, so it’s super cute. 
 
 Over all, I think Love Get Chu is a very good anime, it probably does things differently than other seiyuu shows, since I figure this is a genre that’s hard to really make interesting. The “dark” business and politics of hosting and managing seiyuu is rather unnecessary, but appreciated since it shows some different things. The romance is okay, or more like mediocre; the way Momoko breaks down is very anime, very exaggerated and most definitely not real; the way she handles the truth however, can be very real and that’s a very delicate aspect of a girl’s life to pull off, so good job on that front. 8/10, but only because talking about the art raised it a number. 

          
 
       Helpful So far the only full-fledged story that deals with the life of Anime 
voice actors, or, Seiyuus (There is REC, but not as dedicated as this one). Despite 
the fact that the artwork of this series is of average quality, and that 
filler romance takes up too much time, it does present a lot of 
realistic aspects of the Anime voice acting industry. Highly 
recommended to Seiyuu fans yet do not expect super intelligent 
storyline other than how up-and-coming actors(actresses to be accurate) 
struggle through their green days. 
 
Story: 8/10 
Mixed with somewhat cliche comedy and romance, what's good about the  
storyline is that it faces the true problems of the industry such as commercialization 
of voice acting and more emphasis on the look of the actors/actresses. 
Professionals have to move to front stage to cater to the enthusiastic 
fans curious about other aspects of them that they don't necessarily 
excel at, e.g. singing. The experience of humiliating interview, the 
heart-pressing training school days, and the embarrassing first-job, 
etc. all depict the hurting truth in this career: Here talented+diligent people 
take pain with little gain other than small niche popularity. Yet as in most 
Shounen works, the protagonists managed to find their own positions 
eventually and started to take off with their childhood fantasy. 
 
Comedy elements mostly center around the #1 protagonist Momoko, a  
mindlessly ambitious girl that you saw a lot. Her ignorance of life style 
of Seiyuu conveniently serves as most audience's perspective; that gives 
you a bit of RPG flavor. 
 
The romance (a love triangle) between two actresses and a young Anime 
art designer is kinda filler material and I understand that romance is 
a must for stories like this. Fortunately, the boy in love also provided enough  
inspiration to our girls in focus. 
 
With a luxurious 25 episodes, the story is at first pretty episodic, then when  
the romance sets in, it becomes a little draggy, 
but over the course a lot of character introspection enables us to realize  
the &quot;3D&quot; Seiyuu's fear and joy, often obscured by the happy shinny 2D characters 
that they give life to. The ending is very creative in my opinion in that it tries to  
demonstrate the power of voice acting in a visual fantasy and surely was a lot of fun 
to me. Overall the story works for what it is. 
 
An interesting setting: the agency that the protagonists work for is 
called Lamda 8, while in reality, some of the cast of the series 
are signed to the famous agency called Sigma 7. So apparently a 
semi-pun. 
 
Art: 6/10 
You will see typical Shounen style drawing but the number of colors used 
are fairly limited. Good things is given that Seiyuus often work indoors, there 
are a fairly elaborated outdoor settings as well. Character faces and body  
figures are nothing special. You still see the typical big eyes, slim body  
for example. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
What can I say? Given that this is about voice acting, you get 
to hear quite a few top-notch actors doing what they do and they 
really mean themselves here! Most of the five female protagonists are 
newbies but I really enjoyed 高本めぐみ(Takamoto Megumi)'s performance; 
it was passionate, cheerful, and sentimental at times. Check out 
her voice samples on Sigma 7 homepage 
(http://www.sigma7.co.jp/profile/w_51.html), and you'll probably be 
surprised how this young girl can be multi-facet in 
styles as a lot of the older big names can. I'm really looking forward 
to her further output (There will be one in which she leads again 
early 2009). Veterans such as 三石琴乃, 榎本温子, 若本規夫, 緑川光, all played their 
part properly, as true veterans in the field XD. 
 
Speaking of music, there is nothing to &quot;wow&quot; for, though OP would be 
anther reason to applause Takamoto's talent, where she 
proves herself a capable vocalist with incredible energy, voice 
quality, and vocal range. Another chorus version presented by all 5 protagonists gets 
put on in the latter half to support the plot and is equally nice. 
 
Character: 6/10 
I get the feeling that this story is more of a showcase of the 
industry; a lot of character development should be left with a 
question mark. The #1 protagonist Momoko received much more effort 
than the other four, and thus gets to stand out. 落合祐里香 (Ochiai 
Yurika), though received much more attention than Takamoto in real 
life, falls flat in her part, and disappeared almost entirely in the 
later half. Relatively veteran 山本麻里安, 高橋直純, 新谷良子,  
こやまきみこ all did well, though no screamer. The other new star 
坂本梓馬, who has a boyish girl voice, showed extraordinary vocal 
talent in the OP version 2, but her acting still has a lot of space to  
grow. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Well, as a hardcore Seiyuu fanatics.. I ENJOYED it BIG TIME because 
you don't really have a lot of choice in the entire Anime history that 
deals with the subject. It's self-contained, fun, and somehow 
realistic in the sense of career path in general. I've watched it 
twice and strongly feels that I will come back to it again. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
In short, don't get fooled by the art or technical issues. It's a 
must-have for Seiyuu fans and general audience will learn fairly a lot 
about Seiyuu, voice acting, and voice production from this series. I 
do hope that there will be more of this kind in the future. But I 
doubt it. So cherish the opportunity!

His imagery is abstract, frenetic, and jarring, as a signifier toward the breakdown of celebrity as human, production as craft, and culture as organic.

       Helpful If you notice the length of each episode, you figure out pretty quickly that these two mini-sodes are really just cuteness. The first is a neat one about the bread and alcohol in the show, while the second one is a fan-service of Horo showing how to stretch. No real story to speak of, and with that, not much in the character section. The art was done by one of the animators of the show, so  while it is slightly different from the main style, it's not particularly noticeable. They used the sounds that you're probably used to if you've seen the rest of Spice & Wolf, so no surprises there. 
Overall, it's pretty cute, but mostly useless fluff.

Story 
We all have our hurdles in our life. From a job to a relationship. With a relationship at least from a woman's perspective one feels emotional no matter how it goes. Sadly, life can be exactly how you see on television. Where one finds the origin for those almost glued attributes to categories. From As____ being bad drivers to men being lying scum. Here one gets the idea the singers suffered some heartbreak and find self courage. A really kind hearted message to a troubling time. 
 
Art 
I have stated the message being from negative to positive on relations the art isn't that different. The art rather than being couple (2 players) as one might think is portrayed in a group form. The director here was clever. We already can see from the art or at least tell from the voices the gender standout is female. Safe to say that is the point of view. With the female gender despite what one would think finds strong comfort in females. Even if they are total strangers. The only problem which the director solved with the concept of bounty was what to do as a group since a bar scene was out for it was more two player based. Not only that but to played out. 
 
Sound 
At first i was okay with the tempo as i struggled to get used to the swap from English speaking to back to the negative tongue. Having listened to it multiple times even more so as i write this review i find the idea of swapping a clever concept. For me it demonstrates the start to a breakthrough. Going with idea of straying from the set path. Very clever.

As many may be aware, Ova rarely contain much of a plot so there is not much progression. 
 
Nevertheless, this OVA is hilarious, cute, and gives a new view for each characters ( not that much but ok ).

Well there really isn't much story and your not going to get your ""brainteaser of the day"". If you want that, go to some detective site and try to solve the mystery ( I actually know people who do that ). 
 
Basically, if you watched and enjoyed the original series and aren't seeking to criticize every single possible point such as ""Squid people don't look like Ika musume"", ""aliens don't use magic"" and ""MIT people dont say 'don't mind'""(who knows? they might:P).

So, having used enough the word 'retarded', let me summarize what is this. 
These extras are funny short episodes drawn in MS Paint-like artstyle. There is no storyline, each episode has its own random theme, for example, cooking, siblings, souvenirs, etc.

19,3906,96,5.247984263,Anime with an ensemble casts,H. P. Lovecraft's The Dunwich Horror and Other Stories,"This anime is a compilation of three Lovecraft's works:  The Picture in the House ,  The Dunwich Horror  and  The Festival .",['Horror'],"I've decided to review this since there seems to be only one other review for it on MAL and I have some time on my hands after watching this. But this is my first MAL review so beware! 
 
The first and most crucial thing to note when reviewing this, is that it is definately not an anime in the conventional sense, to quote: 
""This is a collection of 3 stories from the influential horror author, H.P. Lovecraft, namely 'The Dunwich Horror', 'The Picture in the House' and 'The Festival'. Done in claymation, and directed by Ryo Shinagawa as part of the Ga-nime series. 
 
Ga-nime (画ニメ, Ga-nime?), a portmanteau of ""illustration"" (画, ga?) and ""anime"", is a relatively recent trend in Japanese animation to create highly aesthetic short anime films using non-traditional animation techniques, often directed by artists who have limited involvement with the anime industry.""  
 
""Highly aesthetic"" is correct, the claymation alone is highly unsettling, it is crude, awkward and ugly but absoloutely appropriate to the tone and atmosphere of lovecrafts stories.  
 
The claymation in combination with the haunting background music and unsettling narrative styles together create an experience that is as creepy and horrifiying as the source material.  
 
However, one of the few criticisms I have with this is that the claymation, although stylistically appropriate, can sometimes look noticeably cheap and almost like something that came out of a childs science fair diorama, although this was only noticeable for me in the second part of the second segment, and usually only came about with a significant lighting or angle change.  
 
Another criticism is that there is ocassionally a sustained lack of any sort of dialogue, leaving the viewer to piece together the story only through the provided imagery, which does make the unfolding onscreen horrors more potent, but can also make it more difficult to understand what's happening, especially if you don't happen to be familiar with the source materials. However, the music used was haunting and again, very appropriate to the stories and atmosphere.  
 
Overall, this genuinely creeped me out, there were a couple of moments where I got goosebumps or shivered. However I am somewhat interested in lovecraft and as such had some idea of what I was getting myself into. 
 
I would recommend that unless you have some sort of interest or rudimentary knowledge of lovecraft, or happen to be interested in creepy little claymation showcases you give this a miss. If you're unsure either way it is very short and in three segments, the first segment is only a couple of minutes long and how you find that should tell you how you'll find the rest of the OVA, love it or hate it.  


          
 
       Helpful This short film is a collection of three stories written by the infamous H. P. Lovecraft who is considered to be the founder of modern horror. Even though this film is not done in the way we know anime to be made, Toei Animation managed to pull off a decent film using a very experimental form of stop animation that somehow fits the tone of Lovecraft's work. 
 
The designs for the puppets strangely reminded me of Tim Burton's adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book, James And The Giant Peach (minus the live action aspect). So, if you happen to be a fan of that movie and you enjoy reading Lovecraft, then I have no doubt that one will enjoy this film. 
 
People who have not read any of Lovecraft's work and have not heard of him probably won't enjoy this. But, the way the movie is directed and the way the puppets are positioned in most of the shots should be able to follow what is going on in the story, even if they haven't read any of them. 
 
The music is calm and pleasant with an eerie edge to it which makes the viewer feel as if there is something not right with the world and the characters. Though the music usually becomes really dark towards the end of each story. 
 
There is little to say about the voice acting since there is not much dialogue (especially in the third story). The first story only has one of the characters speaking to the silent protagonist while the second story is narrated by one of the three protagonists from the Dunwich Horror story. The final story, The Festival, only has narration for the intro before becoming a fairly silent film with just the sound effects and music. But, since I could not find any information as to who were the voice actors, all I can say is that that they did an okay job and they seemed to be having fun while making creepy and insane voices. 
 
In conclusion, this movie is definitely not for everyone. If you really want to check this movie out then I recommend reading the three stories that make up this film, plus some of his more popular stories including The Call Of Cthulhu and The Rats In The Walls before watching this. Otherwise, if you prefer anime in the conventional sense, rather skip this. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Back in 2007 Toei animation decided to make a short OVA based on some short stories by well known racist Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraftian horror is quite tricky to pull off. Simply because so much of it relies on stoking the audience's imagination and adaptations usually make the mistake of showing too much of the ancient ones and other Stygian creatures. Let's see how Toei handled it.  
 
Story: 
 
There are three short Lovecraft stories in the OVA. We start with The Picture in the House, move to Dunwich and end with The Festival. If you're familiar with Lovecraft's work, you know what kind of content to expect.  
 
The big narrative problem this has, and first major stumbling block it faces as an adaptation, is that the pacing is a bit shite. Good horror needs quiet, slower moments to build up suspense and get the viewer tensed. The problem with the slow moments in this is that so many of them are outright full stops while we pan over a still image. That doesn't build tension, it derails the situation and bores you.  
 
To their credit, the pacing aside, they do a decent job of adapting the scripts of the short stories. They're pretty close to faithful and will likely satisfy those fans of Lovecraftian horror.  
 
Characters: 
 
The characters don't have any real complexity to them. The ones who are meant to be unsettling pull that off well enough. But the ones we're supposed to root for and identify with, we really don't have any reason to care about. They're just a bit boring.  
 
Art: 
 
This is the second major issue with this as an adaptation. The art style does not lend itself well to horror. The OVA looks like it has less of a budget and cheaper claymation than an old Gumby cartoon. And it doesn't help that Gumby also looks more like an Eldritch abomination than anything you see in this OVA. And I'm not just saying that as a joke. That's the trouble with clearly showing the creatures in Lovecraftian horror. When you see a very vague, unsettling description of the Dunwich Horror, it works. When you see a mess of walking squid ink spaghetti, it just looks silly.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting in this is passable. It's not good, but it's not bad either. The music is the same. It's a bit generic for horror music, but it's functional enough.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There isn't any to be sad. The characters barely have relationships to begin with, much less well enough developed relationships for that.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Build up the suspense properly. Don't pause and derail the plot to pan over your clay landscape.  
Don't show your monsters. Take a lesson from Lovecraft in this matter. Show enough to give the idea of the monster and let your audience's imagination do the rest. Trust me, we will come up with something way more frightening than your spaghetti monster.  
Do not use Claymation. There are things claymation works for. Horror is not one of them. The models and environments just look too much like a child's panorama art project.  
 
Final Thoughts:   
 
This OVA has three fatal flaws. The first is the long pauses that derail the suspense. The second is that it shows its Lovecraftian monsters in great detail. The third is the claymation art style. I can't say it's bad, but you'd be much better off reading these stories. I'll give it a 4/10.

Barely made it through the first episode but kept watching because i thought it would change or get better. Then watched about half of the second episode to find theres literally a character with sex offense charges. This anime is good if you like watching a bunch of creeps overstepping boundaries with women. It's not even the good or funny kind of perverted, its just straight up wrong and unbearable to watch. Theres nothing to it, not enough cool car scenes, just guys being creepy. Ive never been so let down by an anime.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, to begin with 
This is not excatly what you probably expect. 
Instead of fast cars and cool races, about half of screen-time is filled with REALLY stupid, mostly slapstick humour, sexism, and basically doing stupid things. 
Okay, if that discouraged you, you can already close the tab with this review, and give up on watching Shakotan Boogie 
But if by any chance, you enjoy watching stupid guys, doing rather dumb stuff 
and on top of that you like JDM culture, i can almost guarantee you that you'll enjoy this show. 
I mean, this show won't change your life, don't have any really strong points either. 
It's just really enjoyable comedy, which don't give a damn, about being right. 
 
 
The plot doesnt really exist, we've got a few characters that are introduced during first two episodes, and they're sticking with us till the end. 
Every episode is separate story, but they still about the same stuff, Cars and Girls. 
fortunately since the anime is just 5 ep it doesnt really matter. 
 
Characters are just good, some of them are generic, some of them have unusal traits, but honestly, they've got literally zero development, they're really simple and exist for most of time just as plot/gag devices. 
And considering the tone of this anime, and length, it's just fine 
 
Art is average, we got really good character designs, girls are looking lovely, and boys look as local deliquents would look. 
 
Can't say much about audio, music was forgettable, except for main theme/opening which was great 
Voice acting was just fine, generic 80's starter pack i'd say. 
 
You won't consider it as masterpiece, you probably won't remember it after five years, but it doesn't really matter since you probably want just to watch a stupid 80's comedy.

       Helpful Sometimes MAL makes you watch the most pointless abominations that you begin to reflect on your own choices in life instead, and these shorts were one of them. It's either awoke and fifth wall breaking message, or just a pointless slideshow that was probably sponsored by MS Paint and directed by elementary school children on a very bad fever. 
Nothing helps but the short length of the shorts. The vocals are absent, you only get a handful of cartoony sound effects at a time. The art is a soulless spooky and annoying to look at drawings that I could have sworn were made by a 1995 version of MS Paint, and even after that went through the process of more pixelation. It did not help with anything. 
The jokes are mostly one-liners that reference few highlights from the second season of the show, very doll most of the time, I only to crack a faint mumble after dropping my guard.

Whether it's some art style changes to something really cool looking for a scene, new characters with cool designs, creative animation, or something else, there is for me at least, always enough new things each episode visually to definitely justify the 5min watch time.

       Helpful Hulaing Babies is fun and nothing else. 
 
It's a psychedelic trip, crazy, wacky and ultimately meaningless.  
Narratively there isn't much going on than what's said in the synopsis, but that's hardly why it's enjoyable. 
 
Hyper condensed fun and aesthetically dreamlike. 
There isn't much animation in terms of frames, but the colour palette and editing make up for this. Its high energy editing keeps things moving and entertaining. The characters have personalities that bounce off each other - sometimes literally thanks to the editing. Everything looks fantastic. Character designs work in perfect synergy with one another whilst complementing the dreamy background art. 
 
The comedy is character-driven and visually spastic.  
There are mostly multiple things happening at a given time. 2 characters having a conversation about something random and in the background, other characters will be doing their own thing. Either playing cat and mouse or bouncing off the walls. At least 1 thing is funny. 
 
The ED is banter. 
Just some dad playing a ukulele sharing some humorously dark stories about his failed marriage and daughter issues, maintaining a light-hearted tone while laughing about it, that feels totally out of place and it's fucking hilarious. Simultaneously acts as a break to calm you down and prepare you for the next episode, do not skip it.

It covers only two days in the life of Teko, Pikari and the two middle school friends of Teko, Chizuru and Akane, who came over to visit her during the summer vacation. This short period of time, however, was enough to well develop the two new characters we are introduced to. I fell in love with both of them, mostly Chizuru.  
The story also focused more on the characters feelings and the time they spend together other than diving (although it was also part of it), which I liked a lot, since the girls are all really cute as a group. The way they share their feelings and talk things out made my heart really warm.  
All in all, it was one of the best OVAs I've ever seen. It was pretty good both as a complement to the previous anime series as it was as a story of its own. Definitely recommend it. 

          
 
       Helpful NOTE: Be sure to watch the original Amanchu! anime before watching this OVA as this is a direct sequel. Watching at least one season of ARIA would be nice too but is not necessary. This review won't have any major spoilers for any series. 
 
Amanchu! is one of the uncommon Iyashikei / healing / relaxing / feel-good slice of life anime. These shows are light on comedy and drama compared to other episodic shows but still find a way to create situations that provide character development and events that make the main characters happy which in turn makes the viewers  feel warm inside. 
 
If you haven't watched the original Amanchu! anime, it's a show about a shy girl named Futaba who's moved to a new city and has trouble making friends.  An energetic girl named Hikari (nicknamed Pikari) gives her a nickname Teko and introduces her to the diving club which causes Futaba's life to slowly change. 
 
As for the OVA itself, it is a worthy sequel and feels just like every previous episode. Without giving away too much of the plot it relates to how Futaba/Teko's childhood friends from her original hometown visit her since they're worried about how she's been adjusting to her new life. It's a really nice story about the importance of old and new friends. 
 
For those who have watched ARIA series (Aria the Animation, Natural and Origination) you may or may not be aware that the original author, Kozue Amano,  wrote both the original manga for ARIA and Amanchu. Futaba/Teko's childhood friends are based on Akari and Aika from ARIA and have similar personality traits, character designs and even the exact same voice actresses!  The characters are different enough where you can differentiate from them the originals and they have their own interesting personalities that relate to Amanchu's story.  
 
As someone who considers both ARIA and Amanchu two of his favorite series ever, having a cameo like this was a really nice treat! Hearing the original voice actresses was nostalgic. The characters/story was different enough that this episode would still be very enjoyable even if there was no reference to the original ARIA characters here. It helped to make this one of my favorite references/cameos in anime/manga I can think of. 
 
The art style is nice and bright, fitting for the relaxing/healing nature of the show. Anytime the characters go diving the animators show how nice it would be to dive that deep underwater, showing all the cool surroundings and how everything looks really nice. 
 
The OP and ED are the same as the original anime, really chill and fitting for the series. The BGM within the series is also really good and fitting for the series. Lots of light instrumentals that fit a relaxing show about a diving club. 
 
If you liked the original Amanchu! (and possibly ARIA series) be sure to check out this OVA as it's one of my favorite episodes in the whole Amanchu series to date.

The thing is this episode is an outlier compared to the rest of the series. 
Changes: 
Ekaterina Kurae is shown as one whose has compassion for her enemies and this time instead of killing them off in a sadistic fashion, she just handicaps them. Also Ekaterina Kurae shows off a little nip which the anime and manga try to refrain from doing due to how young she looks. Then during a scene where Sasha and Otori were caught peeking at the girls while they were getting their measurements, a simple trap in which a log that is tied up comes down and sends them flying. Sasha and Otori should have be able to dodge them, especially Otori as he was as overpowered as they come. Basically this episode messes up the personalities of the characters quite a bit. 

          
 
       Helpful This episode, although it was technically taken from the manga, has major differences, even when compared to the regular anime. For starters, Ekaterina Kurae, also known as Katja, and Teresa Berea show uncharacteristically goofy faces and funny dispositions here, which never happens in the canon storyline. While easily decapitating the heads of her enemies in her calm state, in this episode, despite being very angry at the villain for saying that her chest is small multiple times over (like he is asking for it), which is, again, out of character for her, Kurae only handicaps everyone, destroying the top of the building they are in, like a scene straight out of a kids' show. In addition, she shows nipples in this episode, something the anime (and manga) tries to avoid, probably due to Kurae's age, which is never explicitly mentioned (only that she is in elementary school). Moreover, Sasha has apparently become a pervert who likes to chack out big breasts for research (Jiraiya much?) by peeping on girls changing, while the Human Firecracker prefers small boobs such as his daughter's. Furthermore, they, Martyr Sasha and the Gold Qwaser's right-hand man, the Qwaser of Natrium, also known as the Phoenix of Conviction, are easily caught off guard by a boobytrap (composed of a log, similar to the one Haruno Sakura from Naruto uses in the Forest of Death) which sends the two flying to the sky in a team-Rocket fashion. Finally, the serious religious organization from the manga is portrayed here as just a fake breasts-detox society, led by a boob-crazed failed qwaser, of which element is never revealed, and Shiizaki Ruru, Ekaterina's ""smart"" classmate, turns out to be a horny slut, along with her mother, wanting her own tits to be sucked again by Katja in the end. 
 
Like the show, this episode was ruined by excessive, I will not say ""fan-service,"" because that is fine if done right, but comedy. I recommend giving the manga more priority, since this is one of the anime that is worse on television.

It's light on story, in fact there hardly even is one, but what you get is still very nice. The art is impressive (especially in the second episode) and the sound does its job just fine.

","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Harem']","I dont know whats wrong with these people that seems cant even filter what they are watching and what to expect out of it, while at the end they just give low score review for this one anime, it pissed me off. 
this anime is just your average isekai anime, with nothing special, no intense story such SAO, or deep romance or anything you would ever expect it to be, if that is what you expect to see, get out NOW, this anime wont give any of that. 
Regardless of that, this anime is a VERY ENJOYABLE ONE, it just simply put average story in a VERY ENJOYABLE MANNER, no shit, no war, no epic magic, no annoying girl, just a bit slice of life, a bit moe, a little fun trip, and everything is on the good balance.

          
 
       Helpful This anime faces the same issue with a lot of Anime(s) that falls into this genre. I don't particularly have anything against isekai, hell I don't even mind the character being over-powered (which he was), what I do have a problem with is when a character doesn't seem to fit with who was before in the previous world.  
 
The main character starts as 30 year old, but as soon as he gets to the alternate world, within 15 minutes his voice changes and sounds like 13 year old. His actions, like all other anime in this genre, does not reflect a 30 year old.  
 
There is no plot, there is no clear story-line and as with the most of these type of shows the main character weak. 
 
My recommendation: Better of watching a hentai, it is far more fulfilling than this crap. 

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the most average anime I've seen in quite a while. 
 
Death March has some real identity issues. I have no idea what kind of anime it's trying to be, and I don't think the studio did either. Is it a fantasy adventure? A slice of life? A harem comedy? It attempts to be all of these things at once, and ends up failing at all of them for that very reason. 
 
The massive cast doesn't help. The girls are introduced so quickly that you barely get a chance to learn their names before the next one is tossed into the party. What could have been an interesting group of characters ends up being a boring haremesque mob of nobodies that follow the main character around because he's the main character. 
 
The show does have plenty of fun ideas, but with only twelve episodes it never gets a chance to flesh any of them out. The series length is the single biggest thing holding it back from being a good show, but without a second season it will never be anything more than ""acceptable.""

19,1450,108,5.184972022,Anime with an ensemble casts,Brigadoon: Marin to Melan,"Marin is a typical junior high school girl with a sunny disposition and a loving adoptive family. Her life takes a drastic change when a mysterious mirage is seen in the sky above the entire earth. Killer androids called Monomakia descend to earth from the formation in the sky called Brigadoon and begin to hunt down little Marin. She discovers a blue bottle in a shrine as she seeks escape and from the bottle comes a protector, a sword carrying gun slinging alien called Melan Blue, together they must save the earth and deal with family crisis, school prejudice and the police and come to an understanding of Marins past and Melans unexplained mission, as well as learn to trust each other. Set in 1969 Japan with a colorful cast of friends and enemies. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Most anime series can be neatly categorized into some kind of cliche-ridden group or another: magical girls, mecha, sports, slice of life, ecchi. ""Magical girl"" series, for example, will always have prepubescent girls with colorful wands, long transformation sequences and brains the size of a Chinese dumpling. That, my dear kiddies, is ""cliche"". It causes cancer. 
 
Brigadoon, I am happy to report, does not suffer the cliches usually associated with certain anime categories or genres. It simply doesn't belong to any. In fact, It will quietly defy all attempts at categorization and will summarily step on your face if you attempt it. 
 
Brigadoon Marin to Melan's story revolves around Marin Asagi and a giant humanoid monomakia, Melan Blue. Combining fantasy, sci-fi, action, comedy and drama, it's a happy mix of everything every anime genre has to offer, all packed into 26 episodes. 
 
First and foremost, Brigadoon's story is not something you can appreciate by watching the first 5 or 10 episodes and then jumping to the last episode. Despite all the action and the blood and the killing, Brigadoon is, deep down, a love story, brilliant and intricately built over a span of 26 episodes. Marin and Melan's kiss on episode 26 requires the past 25 episodes to explain; save my keyboard the trouble and just watch all of it. 
 
Second, Brigadoon is not for the faint of heart. Most people will be uncomfortable with a romantic pairing between a 13-year old heroine and a much older-looking hero, and may decide not to even give the series a chance. This is a sad mistake. The most intimate thing that ever happened between Marin and Melan in the entire series was a goddamn kiss, and half the time Melan didn't know what a kiss was to begin with. It DOES have fanservice, but the pantyshots were far in-between and mostly for humor. It shouldn't be a hindrance from enjoying an otherwise brilliant series. 
 
Now that we've got that out of the way, on to the review: 
 
STORY: 8/10. Brigadoon's first few episodes makes it look like your run-of-the-mill, monster-of-the-day anime. Thankfully, it changes its mind and the pace picks up after  three episodes. When it finally does, Marin's brattiness stops and Melan's slam-bang kick-assery begins. 
 
Melan's ""duty"" is heavily fueled by events from Brigadoon's past, but the series manages to avoid too much flashbacks by letting Lolo narrate Brigadoon's backstory little by little. However, there are still some confusing points in the series and even as a fan, I found it hard to follow especially at the last few episodes. A more prominent flaw, however, is the deus ex machina ending. I hate this. It's very abrupt, a little too convenient, and leaves so many unanswered questions that I can't help but wonder if the makers originally had a sequel in mind.  Explaining the motives of the Hensu-chi alone should take more episodes, considering that this is not the first time Brigadoon and earth almost ended because of the Hensu-chi.   
 
ART: 7/10. The fighting sequels were superb. The action shots are tense and speedy, with no repeated cells to make a one-minute fight last five minutes. The character designs for the monomakias were excellent, notably Melan's and Kushatohn's. However, I've noticed that most people dislike Marin's character design; She's supposed to be 13 but she looks everything under 9. And her feet. I'm pretty sure something's wrong with them... 
 
Anyway, that doesn't bother me. What DOES bother me is how the animation tended to screw up at the worst possible moments. There were a few bad sequences in the Submaton Color episode [which was the best in the series], and it irritates me to no end that Melan's first smile in the entire series was drawn by a retard. I actually have to cover half of the freaking monitor with my hands to make Melan look normal! [Thankfully, Melan smiles radiantly in another scene in the same episode.] 
 
SOUND: 9/10. I found Brigadoon's soundtrack haunting and enjoyable, but I'd admit it's not for everyone. Most tracks were Celtic-themed acapella singing, balanced by bouncy instrumental tracks and a fun closing theme. The acapella rendition of the opening song, ""Kaze no Ao, Umi no Midori"" is powerful and heart-wrenching. This provides strong contrast to the catchy ending theme, ""Nijiiro no Takaramono"", sung by the actress who voices Marin herself. 
 
ENGLISH DUBBING: 0/10.  Just think of the English dub as parody dub, then forget it exists and watch the subbed version instead. The English dub made several changes in the character's lines, [e.g. Marin never says ""Ahaaa~"" in the English dub, even though it's her trademark expression in the series] and altered some scenes altogether [Melan and Marin's kiss in Episode 15 seemed to have NEVER happened in the English dub.] 
 
And Marin. Ahh, let me see... it sounds like a fully grown woman trying to sound like a cute 13-year-old, the kind of voice you hear when you dream of little girls asking if you want to play, and when you turn around you see them holding knives dripping with blood, and when they raise it in the air you wake up in the middle of the night screaming. I hate it with all my heart. 
 
Tony Oliver's voice is decent enough, but for a killing machine like Melan its too soft and low, like a whisper that's JUST barely audible. Somewhat like a commentator for a golf show. I don't know, but when Melan gets into a huge catfight involving guns and swords and his voice suddenly reminds me of golf, it kinda ruins the moment. 
 
But more importantly, it's not worth missing out on Melan's Japanese voice. It's emotionless and solid, with a metallic twinge that fits his alien character unquestionably. It constantly reminds you that Melan is a huge bulk of steel and alien flesh you shouldn't mess with. Unless he's talking to Marin, he's ALWAYS unimpressed.I... it's just... perfect. I want to go on, but I can't think of any other words to describe it.  
 
CHARACTER: 9/10. Though it has more than a dozen characters and only 26 episodes, Brigadoon manages to provide enough 'camera time' for most of them. Not enough time for character development per se, but enough for the viewer to grow familiar with and develop empathy towards them. There's Uncle Onando, who never says anything and just keeps throwing peace signs whenever he's onscreen. But I like him, and I don't know why. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10. I've watched the series over three times already, and although I am aware of the series' flaws, it has not stopped me from enjoying it. It's a pretty obscure anime and it's a pity people have not enjoyed it simply because they don't know the series exists. Highly recommended.

          
 
       Helpful I remember watching this series as an twelve year old. Now I am seventeen. When I watched Brigadoon, I watched it overnight nonstop. I was tough when I was younger to strong theme and violence so watching Brigadoon was no trouble. I can still say the series was excellent today. It really came together in a well paced story with an ending that made me smile and remember so well. It's original and complex, you'd definitely enjoy this show if you like action, mecha, and maybe a twist of romance. I understand the show has it's major flaws, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying it so much.

          
 
       Helpful As others have reviewed before, this anime is very hard to categorize and it's due to that, which makes this anime shine. It's not simply a clone of another series. It's what every anime should aspire to be. 
 
First of all, it has the human weapon as male (a rather good looking one at that) rather than female as seems to be the standard in anime, seemingly push this from an ecchi shounen aspect to a more shoujo one. Most series if they want to reverse it, either make the human weapon as some ugly robot, as some monster hybrid or some female cute monster. That's what attracted me to this series in the first place. I was wondering where they would go with this. 
 
After getting hooked to Melan and wanting to see more of him, it's then that the story hits. It really doesn't pigeonhole itself into the ""Proxy battle"", ""Mecha"" affair that it seems like it's going to shove itself into. The mystery deepens when we find out that Melan is protecting Marin for a reason. You want to find out why. Toss in a magical transformation device and some romance and you really feel for the characters. It's stops being about a formulaic trope that so many anime base themselves on. 
 
Others have mentioned the ecchi aspect, but really the way it's done in this series more or lets blends it away. Yes you see Marin's panties, but she's underage and they don't really point to it and say ""HEY LOOK!"" like every other ecchi and non-ecchi anime does and make it the focus of the anime. You find out that the reason you can see them in the first place, is probably because she's poor and doesn't have any money to buy new clothes. Even the scenes of nudity is for a reason and they don't parade it down the street like it's the point of the episode. People are simply nude because they have no clothes, or they can't wear them at the time. 
 
Really over all, the story is VERY original. It doesn't have an aspect you can plop into a category.  Similar to DT Eightron in that respect. The ones who came up with the story actually sat down and probably did some world building versus sit down and go ""Yeah let's make another anime about a harem... with ecchi. Yeah, like those other five hundred out there."" It's really want I want to start seeing in anime. More original stories that don't ruin the experience by having ecchi parts all over the place (Umi Neko and a few other mecha shows), toss in a harem aspect for no good reason (yeah, let's have a bunch of women... for no real reason. If anyone asks... we'll say it's SCIENCE!), or simply be on long string of colosseum battles (YuYu Hakusho, Shaman King, Yu-Gi-Oh, Bleach, the list goes on). It even averts the tried and troped ""Let's have a guy... that controls a woman... but she's really a sword/demon/mecha/killing doll/dingo/familiar!"" It really doesn't want to make me watch another master-slave relationship being played out on TV where the master is male and the slave is female. I see that in real life too much thanks. 
  There are anime where the master is female of course, but they add so much ecchi to it that is shoves it back into the shounen, ecchi, boin, harem category. This averts it by making the master female and a child and the slave a good looking bio-mecha type where you don't see the romance coming until the characters start to get closer to each other. It's played more realistically. 
 
Overall this anime is good, because it doesn't try to be like every other anime out there. It makes it's own path in the world and doesn't rely on tropes and cliche out there to get it done.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']","Minor spoilers.  
 
This review is written with the assumption that you have seen the prequel, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya. 
 
Sense of place. The term can be used in many different ways. For some it may be unique places like ones bedroom, for others it may be about an attachment to a group of people where one feels safe and free to express oneself. We all seek a place to belong, somewhere where warmth emits. Some are lucky to find attachment early during their childhood while others struggle to. When you do not find a place, you feel left outside, alone, scared, cold and that is when one is the weakest and perhaps most aggressive; acting with hostility towards those who have taken your comfortable place out of frustration and fear.  
 
2wei! is a story about finding a place to belong. 
 
The sequel to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei! continues the journey of the two girls, Illyasviel and Miyu. After completing the task of collecting the class cards, Illya and Miyu adjusts to live their life normally after the events. But that does not last long since there is trouble brewing in the complex space. Illya and Miyu are once again needed by Rin and Luvia to deal with the side effects left by the cards. Following the restoration we are introduced to Kuro, the new addition of the story. 
 
Being reminded that others have a normal life does take a toll on one's self confidence and balance, and this is what happens to Kuro. With Illya being surrounded by friends and family, Kuro is constantly reminded of what she lacks. When Illya expresses that she wants her life to return to normal it triggers Kuro making her loathe Illya all the more. Even though surrounded with demoralizing scenes she tries to find a place by taking advantage of Illya’s desires (which Illya is not able to act on because of fear) and attempts to push her out and replace her. This is shown when she advances towards Shirou (who Illya holds a dear crush for) and being sexually suggestive while flirting with him. Her attempts on phasing Illya out eventually ends with a fight and it being interrupted with perfect timing (a bit too appropriately) by a third party, the source of Kuro’s problem itself. As the show progresses the influence of Illya’s continuous friendly advances leads to Kuro being able to find a place in her former enemy’s warmth. Although minor, Miyu plays a role in the story when Kuro challenges the validity of her friendship with Illya which Miyu responds with a strong resolve, and it shows that Miyu has developed during the course of the series. 
 
Even though they had the first season to reflect and improve their show, 2wei! is sadly not an improvement over the first season and the series is faltering. 
 
The themes of friendship and trust that was dealt with in the previous season are now shifted away to give way to the new theme, a place of belonging. Early on the show loses focus on the themes it attempts to deal with. Episodes leading up to the climax favors comedic events spawned from Kuro’s interactions and these events take too much time of the shows constricting episode count. Episode 4 being the biggest offender with it being about a game of dodgeball which is dragged out to the point that would make a taffy confectioner jealous. The dodgeball game serves little purpose in the narrative with its intentions being about eliciting chuckles and to mystify Miyu and the school nurse, perhaps hinting the upcoming events of the series. 
 
The theme is vaguely hinted throughout the story from Kuro’s hostile and apathetic actions towards others, and her reaction from Illya’s questioning about her reason to remove Illya out of the way. It is later clarified why Kuro acted the way she did, but it does not leave a satisfying conclusion. There is a sharp contrast with how light and playful the the story was compared to the event leading up to the climax, and the bridge leading up to it gives little time to empathize with Kuro. With these reasons the climax did not reach its full potential and in the end falls flat. 
 
Although humor is a part of the series, anything but the interactions between the main characters are so weak that they detract time only to attempt a flat and dull gag. It also feels artificial and forced. The shows side characters are significantly degrading ones experience, to the extent that you cannot enjoy the show whenever they pop-up. Tatsuko being the energetic and feisty troublemaker, Suzuhana the mature one, Nanaki the one who just goes along with anything and Mimi the one with lacking presence. They are all simplified, fitting common tropes and serve to share the burden of the main cast to supply amusement. This shows a lack of trust given to the main characters ability to elicit laughter. The memorable and great moments of fun are risen naturally from the main characters interactions. 
 
One side character to note is Shirou, that lacks any purpose in the story other than to make the main characters, as well as Rin and Luvia, lose control and behave out of character. Two notable scenes are when Miyu clings to Shirou like a vulnerable puppy and scuttles away, and Rin and Luvia trying their best to look impress and get his attention. It feels out of place and is one of the downsides with the show. The influence he has on the girls and their feelings for him feels out of place whenever they are in the same scene. We are never explained why the girls feel the way they do towards him, and it does not have any impact at all. It just gives rise to an awkward and confusing scene. It also gives a sense of a subplot being that the girls are a part of a harem romcom with Shirou being the typical dull and oblivious main character. 
 
Although flawed, the series is enjoyable to a certain degree. The interactions between the characters does spawn great moments of comedy; in particular, the way Illya reacted and her face when she was seen by her classmates in her magical girl outfit is one the funniest parts of the show. The scene in episode 2 where Kuro explores the mysteries of Miyu’s mouth might be weird to watch, but it sure offers a kind of fan service that is tasteful without detracting the characters to simple sexual objects. How the camera angles during that scene showing Illya in the background with the two girls kissing in the forefront and the fact that the camera lingers shortly close to them and quickly backs away to give them space gives the idea of the camera respecting their moment. The way Illya observed them during that scene reflects perfectly how I reacted to it, and it shows that the producer knows its audience and what reaction they expect. Interestingly enough there is a reason behind Kuro’s kissing, however it is not convincing enough to pass it off since there are other ways she can recharge her mana which does not require her to force herself onto other girls. 
 
It is also a pleasure to see how Kuro slowly warms up to the rest of the cast as the show goes on. The antagonist that is introduced later in the second half ramps up the girls relationship. The battle that follows shows how well the CGI complements the action that is displayed. The animation of the characters are well done and smooth, and it does not detract the exhilarating action. In contrast to the light and bright scenes in the first half of the show, the dark arc in the end fits well since it serves to strengthen the girls bond by inserting a common enemy which they will have to work as a team in order to defeat it. This allows the girls develop their characters even further, and gives Miyu, Rin and Luvia some needed screen time. 
 
Illya’s character design has never looked this good before, making other works design of her look poor in comparison. Miyu and Kuro are no exception to the lovely design as well. Silver Link’s strength regarding animation are character design and CGi, and they sure do know how to draw characters with a great consistency. The shows CGI looks amazing with its natural presence unlike other shows which feature CGi that looks out of place. The lighting applied to the scene are nicely represented, and the shadows covers and wraps around the objects and characters they are on decently giving a decent overall look. Other than the CGI, the overall animation quality is decent The soundtrack and background music does not impress. It does its job, but being simple regarding synths and tunes, as well as the background music during the fight scenes feeling more like a dance than action pumping sound it leaves one unfulfilled. There are not any notable or memorable soundtracks. At least the ending song is nice, fitting well into the shows light and magical feel with its instruments sounding very light and giving a cheery and girly overall sense. 
 
Sometimes there are shows that pop up which are incredibly popular with the help of it being a part of a popular franchise or something else. Prisma☆Illya is one of those shows, risen to heights with the help of the Fate-franchise immense popularity. Even though mediocre, it offers fans of the Fate-franchise a mahou shoujo spin-off with the ever so popular girl, Illyasviel. 
 
Cute girls in cute outfits is what Prisma☆Illya is all about. With a heavy sprinkle of magic, friendship and acceptance it paints itself like any other generic Mahou Shoujo but within the Fate universe. Although the show handles itself decently at some aspects its dynamic between philosophy and humor falters, and it offers nothing new and should be treated as nothing more but sugar. For the fans of Illya, I suggest hopping onto this series since Illya has never before been more beautiful and cute. She looks lovely but the shows she stars in are anything but.

          
 
       Helpful Before I start if you haven't read or seen the first season of Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya then either read my review or watch the first season and then come back here.  
 
So if your still here welcome back to Fuyuki City where Illya's normal life still gets disrupted but only this time by a full blown clone of herself. 
 
In other words the sequel is even more interesting then the first season as it moves away from the magical girl tropes and into the Fate tropes that everyone knows and loves. keep in mind the Magical Girl tropes are still there but not as much as the first season. 
 
The art and sound are beautiful to look at and to listen to as well as this series uses water and bubbles as part of the art style in certain scenes as for the sound well just listen to the ending theme and you would understand why that song was chosen and is part of the story.  
 
Character development was key again in the sequel as we see more of Illya's friends and their weird little quirks and other new characters like the servant and someone form the church association but the major character development was Kuro a new character added to the series as she went from I want to kill the person who looks like me to I want to live a normal everyday life like everyone else including Illya. 
 
In other words I enjoyed the sequel as it had everything the first season had and multiply it by 1000 or a lesser number so if you are looking for a magical girl style anime or if you like the Fate series in general or the first season then you will like this one 

          
 
       Helpful The fan service was lacking overall and there was a lot of CG for no reason, but I considered it a step up from the previous series. 
 
I typically say to people that if they enjoy mahou shoujo and loli fan service they'll probably like Prisma Illya, but 2wei is where the world building starts picking up steam and the Fate/ references stop being benign cameos and start being important background info and foreshadowing.  
 
Basically this is where stuff starts to get interesting for Prisma Illya, but emphasis on ""starts to,"" because 2wei overall feels like an interlude to the real climax in 3rei. It does have a lot of great twists (mostly in the latter half) that are pretty rewarding though. So to that effect this first cour will probably give you some dramatic blue balls, since most of the major plot lines don't even really start 'til Bazette shows up late in the season.  
 
If you don't like Type-Moon and are watching this for the little girls, then hold on to your butt or prepare to bail in this cour. 
 
That's it, I'm out.

Shirobako. The show that defied my expectations so much, it changed my view on the anime industry forever. The anime industry is a harsh environment, that's for sure. Shirobako is the ingenious and simply brilliant show that delves into this harsh environment. The laughter, the struggles, the tears, and the sweat that goes into making an anime is expertly expressed in a way that I will never be able to forget.  
 
When it comes to pure entertainment, it's hard to surpass Shirobako. It drags you into a world that us anime viewers were always curious about, and it keeps you there with its brilliant depictions of everyday life. Shirobako is quite possibly the most educational show I have ever watched. Not only does it show you the behind the scenes work of an anime, but it also uses the hard life of an anime studio to teach you some simple yet useful life lessons. Very relatable things such as chasing your dreams, planning your future, asking yourself ""Why am I doing what I am doing?"", and that it's ok to rely on others and that teamwork is important. The show also gives insights on how to be a leader. The way this show weaves in these messages with the story and the character development makes the lessons even more impactful, and that is why Shirobako is such a brilliant show. 
 
In other words, Shirobako is a great example of a show-don't-tell series. 
 
Pros: 
- Characters, man. The characters in this show are all unique from each other and have their own distinct personalities. All of the characters. And there are A LOT of characters. 
- Art is gorgeous and the animation is amazing and creative.  
- Voice acting is super on fleek. It's fabulous. 
- Amazing messages and lessons are expressed. You've probably experienced these life lessons before, but Shirobako expresses them in a way that really engraves them into your heart. 
- Amazing comedy! Whether it be plain old jokes or parodies on real life anime titles (Neon Generation Avangaldon xD), this show will make you laugh! 
- This series has some really intense moments. Like a Thriller tag is applicable to some points of the anime. 
 
Cons: 
- Some of the main characters are underdeveloped, especially Shizuka, the redhead seiyuu. I feel like she deserved more love. 
- Some of the jokes won't hit home to some, as you need some knowledge about anime to understand them. 
 
Story: 9 
The story follows the life of Miyamori Aoi, who is a production assistant at Musashino Animation. It mainly follows her and her friends' daily lives as they follow their dreams and work hard. The overall story may not seem special, but it will surprise you. The way they go in depth to the professions that the protagonists experience really takes you to another world. This was a show where a LOT of research was done to pull it off. The character development was amazing and the dramatic and comedic moments were very well written. 
 
Art: 10 
The animation of animators animating their animations was spot on. The animation of this series was very creative, as it highlighted many different animation techniques used in anime (cause it's an anime about making anime.) The way the show switches between the animating style of ""real life"" and other anime within this anime (this is getting confusing) was really amazing. Also, incorporating CG animations to showcase the CG animators inside this anime was also well done. This was also one of the few anime where background characters weren't still images and you can see them going about their lives. Anime-ception is now complete. 
 
Sound: 10 
The OST was well suited for the series, and the OPs and EDs are all catchy! But it's all about the voice actors/actresses. Holy damn, they fit their roles and situations perfectly. The way they voice act a voice actresses in the anime who is voice acting for an anime within the anime (holy crap) was spot on. I felt like this show was one that required a lot of effort from the voice actors/actresses, and I feel like they pulled it off spectacularly.  
 
Characters: 10 
5 girls chasing their dreams in a way that only they can. This show is definitely a character driven show. Despite having a HUGE plethora of characters, they all have such diverse characteristics that make them very distinguishable from each other and very likable. They have their own ambitions and opinions and take shit from no one but themselves. They all have their nice and selfish sides. A lot of detail was put into their characteristics, even to the most irrelevant of side characters. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
An enlightening series that pasted a smile on my face and had me at the edge of my seat during the super intense moments.  
 
Overall: 10 
I'm totally biased, but there is no such thing as a not-biased review. So I'm going all out. This show was an experience like no other.

          
 
       Helpful Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless. 
 
You see, Shirobako does do a good job at putting on the line some of the goals and aspirations the characters want to do, even if it's half corny and generic safe responses and the other half is mostly what would feel natural for someone that has entered into the industry making a decision that fits their original goal presented in a situation that makes sense. Well maybe it's more like, 60-40%. Well... maybe... erm... 
 
Anyway, what it absolutely fails to do is present the situation of the working space in a believable way. You see there is this director who is, putting it mildly, the absolute worst thing in the world. He constantly procrastinates, he is usually indecisive and he had no sense of direction to the point that when he was asked what he wanted to do with his series, his answer was simply ""moe"". That was his answer for why he created the series and where he wanted to take it. I'm sure anyone, despite however rancid might think has gotten and maybe wanted to capitalize on the moe factor, if that was at all the case in this director's case, would have at the very least an idea on how to capitalize on moe and give a different answer. But, no, he said that because he was asked what were his original intentions with the series in order to get help from another writter, and that was his answer. And he's already known in the industry for his poor direction and what not, because he had failed on directing another original work called ""Jiggly Jiggly Heaven"" which is exactly what you're probably thinking. I won't represent him as antagonistically as I can, but trust me, he seems very unqualified all throughout the first cour. 
 
The reason I'm mentioning all this and I'm stopping here is because I want to ask you the following questions:  
 
Would you work under him?  
 
Now think a bit before you answer because these are the guarantees of your job: you will probably be forced to take a lot of retakes due to his indecisiveness and work under a very limited timespan due to how much he's delayed writing the storyboards due to him procrastinating, which would make the retakes that much more difficult. Also keep in mind that he has a terrible reputation and if you're there and he fails he probably is going to drag you down with him as well. Maybe you're asking yourself how would I have known which, okay, good point, then I'm gonna ask you the following question instead. 
 
What would you do when you found out he's this way? 
 
Would you continue working so the anime won't be a permanent stain on your resume and make it as great as possible, would you bail because as soon as you could before you would be able to have it as a permanent stain on you or would you have an outburst at the director and tell him to get his shit together? Or would you simply just quit as soon as the project is done? I mean, you would feel at every point like you're in a sinking ship, right? Or maybe if you wouldn't, someone else at least would? 
 
Except that's not what happens. Most people continue working so the work won't leave a permanent impact on their reputation in the industry but there is absolutely nobody, except one guy who downright forces the director to work. There's nobody that expresses any sort of frustration at the chaos the director has caused at things that are completely his fault. They had opportunities to do so with a bunch of characters, but no, they instead chose this path with this character: ""Everyone struggles until the asshole finally fucking gets some inspiration and then everything ends fine and dandy."" I can't imagine in a realistic situation where there wouldn't be at least one person lashing out or at the very least talking the director behind his back for being this pathetic at what he's doing, hell, I barely can imagine someone being this tolerant in a fictional scenario built in my mind. Instead people just take it and do their work and eventually the director stops fucking around. You could've given the director some motivation to correct his ways through consequences of his work force simply not accepting what he's doing by lashing out at him or quitting or anything. But, no, that would make too much sense. Lets instead have his actions have very little voiced consequences and everything ending up pretty much okay. 
 
And this is the main problem with Shirobako, whenever there is a problem, everything ends up okay in the end, to the point where you get to the content of the second cour, where everything works even better in the project and the director isn't even a problem anymore, whenever a ""oh my god a setback"" happens there's no sense of urgency behind it and the tension from this type of situation is pretty much gone. There's no consequence to things going wrong other than, okay, lets work a little bit harder mkay? Okay. You're writing a story about an industry, there's always a risk for someone doing a bad job, but quitting and being fired are totally natural responses a person or a company could take in these situations. Failing a deadline or the work suffering a drop in quality are also possible consequences of incompetence or simply harsh conditions. As a result of this, none of the events happening in Shirobako have any dramatic value, despite trying to build them up and failing spectacularly at them. You know they will strive to make things in the series as optimistic as possible while creating tension with only one result, you feeling relieved it worked out. 
 
It looked like all the characters were pulling punches in the hopes that things will work out and they will somehow manage, which made me feel very cynical about the whole experiences they've went through. 
 
That was what mostly almost kinda made me drop the series a bunch of times but instead I continued watching the series because quite frankly, I enjoyed the parts where Shirobako presented the motivations and ambitions the characters had in the industry, or their loss of motivation and how they got over it. It does do a genuinely good job with that whenever they don't go on the safe route and offer some sort of insightful advice through a conclusion you could draw out from what the characters experience which is a good thing to see. Like what happens when you lose inspiration (no, I'm not talking about the director) or when you are stuck in a loop where you don't get any experience that would help you improve in the future. If the story focused more on this aspect of what it was trying to do while creating tension and focusing more on how to get over yourself and how you've achieved that and what consequences this could have not only on you but also on the team, I'm sure this could've been quite good, but it wasn't. I thought this aspect was enough for me to second guess calling this show bad, but I can't say it's fine for the lack of repercussions for every problem in the series that has appeared in it and making it seem quite unrealistic.  
 
The art style of the show is generally good, given its a show about creating anime and animation plays a big part in it, most things are animated well. Everything looks well put together and you could technically see the process behind it too, which will probably help you have a better appreciation of it. The art style is a bit too cutsey for me but, I can say that it looked good regardless. The sound was generally fine too, although if I caught a glimpse of either the intro or ending I would immediately get turned off because I hate j-pop, and there are some downright cringy moments in the series that are meant to be heartwarming when the main character along with her friends go on and say this: ""DON DON DONUTS LETS GO NUTS!"". Ugh. 
 
As you might or might have not guessed from what I've already said, the purpose of the characters is mostly to display one aspect of the industry or that area of expertise through either shared wisdom or experience or the difficulty said person might have in their area. The situations presented by them tend to be hit and miss but they usually are enjoyable enough for what they're trying to do and they tend to have some insight into them. 
 
If you think you'd be frustrated by the lack of consequences the problems in the series, like the poor direction or the problems created by the staff itself, having little to no consequences to the overall quality on the series could be a hurdle for you, or the fact that the interpersonal relationships of the series being treated so casually is a really bad thing just like me, I can't recommend this series to you at all. But if you think some of the insight Shirobako might provide into the industry might be worth it, although I would suggest looking for some documentaries that might offer the same insight into the industry from real people talking about real experiences, you could have a look into it. As I've said, it does present some insightful situations and how people get over their own hurdles, which might be something you want. But I don't know if that would justify it as a good series for you, given it's possible you could get the same feedback from different sources. I managed to enjoy Shirobako enough to finish it and thought it was an okay enough experience, despite the hurdles, but I can see them being too much for other people as well.

          
 
       Helpful Very rarely does an anime come out and I describe it as unique; Shirobako is an exception. I have a very hard time coming up with any anime that remind me of Shirobako, because it is just so unique. It's an anime ABOUT making anime, so it's almost as if P.A. Works knew they were going to have an instant success on their hands. Shirobako is much more than that. It is simply an amazing experience. 
 
Story - 9 
     
Shirobako is about making anime. And that's it. They story just goes from there, talking about everything from production problems to character designers to even 3D work. It's amazing how much detail they cram into only 24 episodes. The only reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because the story isn't incredibly strong, and relies heavily on its characters, which isn't really a bad thing, it's just that it isn't as strong as it could have been. That said, it is still better than 90% of other anime that came out in 2014/2015. 
 
Art - 7 
 
The art isn't the best P.A. Works has done (That would be Nagi No Asukara in terms of fluidity and Another in terms of art design), but it's still solid. It takes everyday situations, and designs them in fantastical ways that make it much less realistic than it could be, but that's part of it's charm, and I kind of prefer it this way. Also, the character designs are amazing and some of my favorite designs in a while, particularly the designs for Shizuka and Seiichi. Also, Ogasuwara. 
 
Sound - 7 
 
The soundtrack doesn't distract from the show, and there isn't much to talk about. I like the openings and endings, but they are nowhere near my favorites. The reason it gets a 7 is because of all the voices. Seiichi's voice in particular is so lovable, I don't know if any English voice actor will do any of the characters justice. Weird, because normally I'm not a dub hater, I rather like dub, in fact, but this might be one of the few shows that I won't be able to watch the dub for because I've gotten attached to the characters' voices so hardcore. They're that good. 
 
Characters - 10 
 
This. This is where Shirobako truly shined. I was gonna write a big long paragraph here, but I'm lazy, so let me just say that they are all brilliant and probably the best ensemble cast I've ever seen in an anime. My favorites are Miyamori, Shizuka, Seiichi, Iguchi, Okitsu(because she's a badass), and Ema(because of that dance in episode 16).  They are amazing. 
 
Enjoyment - 9 
 
The show gets one point of for enjoyment because the opening episodes didn't grab me as much as the later ones. Still, amazing overall. Thoroughly entertaining, I was almost never bored. 
 
Overall - 10 
 
For the longest time, I've been searching for an anime similar to the American version of The Office, and I finally found it in Shirobako. It's a workplace comedy that isn't just about the comedy, and all the characters gel so nicely with one another, it's insane. Most of all, though, is that after watching Shirobako, you gain an appreciation for every anime you've ever seen, because of all the hard work put into all of anime. This is why I consider Shirobako to be one of the 5 anime that I consider mandatory viewing for any anime fan, with the others being the anime closest to your other favorite TV show, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop, and School Days, all for varying reasons. But, those are reviews for another day. In the meantime, I'll just be here, in my room, waiting impatiently for Shirobako Season 2.

Quite a nice little video that will lift your spirits up when having a bad day! 
 
Story: 7/10 
The story is not particularly deep for its short run, as you will mostly see the mom and her little boy&rsquo;s day progress from early morning to bedtime. This starts with them waking up and eating breakfast, to taking a walk in the park and so on. All scenes that here are fun to watch, as they both happily enjoy their day. There was one scene where the mom seemed to get a sad phone call. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was about, perhaps her boyfriend stood her up, or she didn&rsquo;t get that one job she needed, but after spending time with her son she knew it would turn alright in the end. The video helps to remind us of the things we may take for granted, and is all in all a very happy go lucky story, certainly nothing new by any means, but a fun watch none the less. 
 
Artwork: 6/10 
The artwork is pretty fair I guess, though not really up to par with most 2005 titles. The backgrounds can range from nice and colorful, to lightly drawn and kinda bland. The characters themselves do stand out above them though, so this could have been done intentionally on some scenes, in order to keep your eyes on the characters. While the whole video quality is a bit on the low side, it certainly isn&rsquo;t the worst you would see. And honestly, I really dug the character design in this, what with their soft tender facial expressions.  
 
Soundtrack: 9/10 
A great happy J-pop beat plays throughout the video, and remains so until it ends., doesn&rsquo;t really loop or get repetitive. While some may find it to be a bit on the childish side, it does complement the on screen scenes to a &quot;T.&quot; Certainly not the happiest beat out there, but it more than works for this video. 
 
Characters: 7/10 
Well the mom and son never talk, and mostly just smile at each other for the major part of the video. But the chemistry I felt from them was great, its a special kind of feeling that can only come from a mother and her child, and does implement this affect very well, I really could feel the connection that these two shared! It really gives you a sense that a single parent can truly make it in life! 
 
Bottom Line: 7/10 
I can&rsquo;t promise you you&rsquo;ll love this video, as some might find it too unrealistic or even a bit childish to enjoy. However, this is a great title that will put you in a good mood when you might be having a bad day. Whether your watching it to get good memories of the way your childhood may have been, or perhaps only wish all of ours could be as happy as their&rsquo;s was. I think most of us will agree that its a great video that will leave you with a smile on your face after viewing it. That even though life may be troubling at times (the scene with the mom), we will always have tomorrow to look forward to!

19,31138,112,5.134730832,Anime with an ensemble casts,Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades,Specials bundled with the Blu-ray and DVD volumes of  Overlord  featuring simplified character animations.,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy']","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful Hello Mal users, 
 
this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

19,33820,113,5.134730832,Anime with an ensemble casts,Ao Oni The Animation (Movie),An animated film series based on the  Ao Oni  game. It will feature a new story.,"['Mystery', 'Horror']","I'd like to start off this review with a few warnings. First and foremost this review will contain spoilers. Second; if you haven't seen the movie here's a tip. DON'T. 
 
I've been a fan of the ao oni game for a long time. I was excited for the short animated series to come out but unfortunately it was a flop. Then I heard there was going to be an animated movie. ""At least it can't be worse than the series"" I thought to myself. I was wrong. 
 
Story: 1 
 
The story(?) revolves around a club who finds out their town has a urban legend that's similar to the ao oni game. They get in contact with the creator of the game in hopes to find out more about how the two are connected. The first half is mostly talking. Just a bunch of students sitting around a desk talking. So exciting. In the second half we find out that the ao oni is living... under the school.... One by one the students start to get picked off but it's impossible to care since none of them have anything close to a personality. In fact I just found myself laughing every time it happened. Then somehow it turns out one of the students has been having sex with a plant, which caused his genitals to rot and fall off and turns him into an ao oni. I wish I was joking. I really really do. People keep dying and then the movie throws one last plot twist at us but honestly all I could think about at the time was how close I was to finishing the god awful thing. 
 
 
Art: 1 
Studio Deen why. The art is purely CG, which if done right isn't usually that bad. In this case though? It was bad. Real bad. You'd find better animation watching one of those stupid Vocaloid MMD music videos on YouTube. It was painful to watch.  
 
 
Sound: 2 
The only reason I'm giving the sound a 2 is because I'm in love with Shikata Akiko who does the films ending theme. The background music was bland and forgettable, but at least they kept the classic Ao Oni theme in there. The voice acting was nothing special and I honestly pity every voice actor who had to be a part of this. 
 
Character: 1 
The characters were unlikeable and none of them had a personality. It's hard to find a character death sad when you have no attachment to said character thus every single one of the deaths made me laugh. Hell I don't even remember any of there names even though half of the movie was them shouting each other's names not to mention the fact that I started writing this right after the movie ended. The character designs were bland too. It was just a horrible cast. 
 
Enjoyment: 1 
N O 
 
In all this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not even worth a watch for the comedic moments and by that I mean character deaths. How can something like this even be considered a horror. Instead of watching this movie I suggest just going back and playing the game, or maybe watch a playthrough of it. All I can do now is wish for that hour of my life back and try to somehow cleanse my brain of this shitshow they tried to call a movie. Please love yourself and don't watch it.

          
 
       Helpful If you thought the Ao Oni comedy shorts were bad, wait until you see this - it's even worse. The comedy shorts are a masterpiece compared to this tripe. 
 
Story: This is apparently a story based off the game; too bad there is no story. The majority of the hour long movie is the characters sitting around talking and nothing happening. It takes place in a school, not in the usual mansion. There is a story there somewhere, but it's lost in the boring, awkward telling. 
 
Animation: Studio Deen, who brought us such animation fail classics like Axis Powers Hetalia and Higurashi, are the animators of this. I was hardly surprised when I found out they were responsible. Needless to say, Studio Deen have kept up their trope of animating badly, leaving the series looking like a slightly updated version of MMD. The expressions of the character are poor and almost ridiculous even by anime standards and the characters move slow and stiff like machinery. And the animation of the monster is just terrible. It's also in 3D, not that watching it in 3D makes it any better or easier to get through. 
 
Sound: The voice acting is pretty decent but not great. The music is irritating and drove me to despair. I had to pause every few minutes just to take a break. Honestly I wonder whether the voice actors will have careers after this. 
 
Characters: The characters in this movie aren't Hiroshi & co, but a bunch of new characters. There's zero character development, the characters are one-dimensional, boring and have the personality of a gnat. There's no way you can form connections with the characters or even like them. I don't even remember their names.  
 
Enjoyment: I hate every single second. I get more enjoyment from watching paint dry. There's no horror, no nothing. 
 
Overall: 0/10. This is the worst thing I've ever seen and if I could give myself amnesia so I could forget this, I would. Avoid this and the comedy shorts, watch something better.

Many people say that the chibi anime was better but let's be honest it's not :3 
We don't know the story of Aoonie and the game doesn't need to be the only example of Its story, we don't always need to be in a mansion -_- (We're no Ricegum or Pauls) 
This story is amazing and it takes Aoonie to the whole other universe :P BUT I GUESS THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE WHERE THE AOONIE IS CAPTURED AND KEPT IN THE MANSION UNDER SOME MAGIC TALISMAN AND HAVE A SCENE AT THE END WITH THE 4 CHARACTERS FROM THE GAME SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD FINALLY FEEL F*ING GOOD HUH? (Hey that's a pretty good idea XD)

Yes and since this is an ""event"" that means we once again switch out Gran with Djeeta. This special is but a simple plot of trying to find a lost boy during a Halloween festival with a ""Lost Jack"" lurking the the shadows. 
 
To be expected of a Halloween special, the main gang of Lyria, Djeeta, Vyrn and new characters Cagliostro and Ferry join them in this Halloween special, Cagliostro being a snarky summoner and Ferry a Ghost Girl, where they get Trick or Treated, eat lots of candy and cookies and find the lost boy and Lost Jack in the process. 
 
The animation once again done by A1-Pictures is done to it's great detail from the original series including the newly decked out characters designs (sans Vyrn), with all their Halloween costumes and the atmosphere of being a Halloween festival is prominent in the animation. 
 
The voice acting is decent enough, though LA was kinda surprised that Cagliostro was voiced by SAKURA TANGE of all people with what LA could predict that the mother of the lost boy being voiced by Satomi Arai and the lost boy himself sounds like Mariya Ise?. Nonetheless a VERY great cast and happy to hear Nao Touyama as Lyria and Hisako Kanemoto back as Djeeta from the final episode of the original series back. 
 
Really if anything this Granblue Fantasy special is an oddly uplifting Halloween episode, with having a rather heartwarming moment of where both the living and the dead get to have fun together (hey it's almost like it's celebrating Japanese Bon Festival) and it emanates through the rest of this special, yes even the part of Lost Jack of all things being the catalyst to it all. Usually Halloween episodes are meant to scare you or be horror-filled jump scares but Granblue Fantasy's is different by having the aesthetics of Halloween right for a fantasy land, but giving off a contrasting atmosphere of heartwarming and heartfelt moments and heck it did it to great effect.

Another one with the female character being used which is not a bad thing. Bit of confusion with the characters for a new one appears like she has always been there but wasn't shown particularly before and also our main character out of nowhere uses magic that wasn't from before.

This is from the impressions of someone who only has knowledge on on Tales of game (Tales of Hearts R on the Playstation Vita) and is going to be playing this Zestiria game when it release on Ps4 exactly 6 hours.  
 
Story (7/10) Good 
 
Obviously like I said before not knowing anything about this other than it's a Tales game, this story from what I am assuming will before about your first few hours when you first play the game as we are introduced to the main character and two other characters. This obviously serves as an introduction to them, the world of Zestiria and where they stand in it currently. Not going to give synopsis I don't do that, just know as far as an introduction as an anime I say it gets the job down making me interested in the three main characters that I will probably be playing with first when I start to play the game. 
 
 
Art and Animation (9/10) Great  
 
C'mon people.. it's Ufotable we are talking about here. I should just leave it there and move on to the next category but what the hey let's give credit where credit is due. Ufotable once get hits us with a really well animated and anime adaptation of a video game. Apparently they've been doing anime adaptations for the Tales of series for a while now and I can see why Bandai Namco allows them to they do a great job. It's probably why Badai Namco allowed them to animated God Eater also.. but we aren't going to talk about that lol. Anyway the artstyle is easy on the eye and the little fighting they we got to see in this 40 someodd minutes OVA was great, yeah there could have been more but I understand why it was so little. Plus as far as I heard Zestiria is getting a full anime adaptation next year so expect everything you want from that adaptation version. But as far as we got the the sword play choreography and animation behind it we get to see from the MC Sorey was great and the CG animated spell attacks from Mikleo were great also, they really get you hyped if you are going to play the game in the future. 
 
 
Sound (9/10) Great 
 
The music chosen for certain scene I thought were spot on. Nothing that blew my mind but not everything needs to. It had a lot of laid back moments in this OVA so laid back music from the OST was played and during the conflict of the OVA it definitely sounded like a song I'll be hearing when I play this game, playing a Tales game before I know what those type of songs sound like and it was quite authentic. 
 
 
Characters (8/10) Very Good  
 
The characters Sorey, Mikleo and Alisha all kind of remind me of combination of characters from Tales of Hearts R whether it's in appearance or initial personality.  
 
Sorey I felt a combination of Kor and Kunzite  
(Kor resemblance - a brown hair main character who finds an unconscious girl)  
(Kunzite resemblance - i little bit ignorant in regular behavior but knowledge on the lore of his universe) 
 
Mikleo I felt a combination of Chalcedony and Hisui 
(Chalcedony resemblance - A little bit in appearance but with white hair and he also gives off the same vibe as Chalcedony) 
(Hisui resemblance - He's the second male main character we are introduced to that fights along side the MC in a friendly rival type of way. And it looks like Sorey and Mikleo brothers Sorey being adopted? I mean you have to assume that Kor eventually got with Kohaku thus being brother in laws with Hisui in the future no? Assumptions that's all they are i know but not far-fetched predictions on what proabbly happened lol)  
 
Alisha I felt a combination of Kohaku and Chalcedony  
(Kohaku resemblance - The first female character met by the MC unconscious, kind of shy at first, slowly opens up ehh Kohaku kinda opened up quickly tho but anyway, they both don't showcase any of their combat abilities at the beginning of each story)  
(Chalcedony resemblance - Obviously the obvious on that both Alisha and Chalcedony belong some sort of Kingdom but that's probably where it ends anything else is debatable)  
 
Funny how these characters remind me of a combination of previous Tales of Characters when the new gimmick for Tales of Zestiria is to fuse/combine characters together LOL. Anyway NONETHELESS even though they remind me of previous Tales characters that's not looked at as a flaw to me they were still unique in their own way and will most likely have unique character development like the Hearts R roster. 
 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) Good 
 
I feel I got good enjoyment out of this OVA, I would assume it's definitely more enjoyable if you are about to dive into this universe of Zestiria like I am in a few hours but for someone who isn't it is debatable if they would get any enjoyment pass a 7 but all it is is an introduction so hopefully they take this with consideration. 
 
 
Overall (8/10) Very Good 
 
So like I said before the purpose of this OVA was most likely to introduce you to the first few hours of Tales of Zestiria I'll be surprised if the video game doesn't start off the exact same way this OVA did because then I'll have some questions, I felt this was a very good starting point to the story.  
 


          
 
       Helpful First time ever writing a review, figure it's a new year, time to try writing reviews. Ok, that aside, on with the review: 
 
This will be spoiler-free, rest assured.  
 
Story: 6/10 
There isn't much to say about the story - it builds up a world, but it's only within the framework of roughly 40 minutes or so. Much doesn't really happen; there is a small direct conflict physically portrayed in the episode, and then the conflict mentioned but not shown as part of the world-setting/backdrop.  
Given that this episode was released under the pretense of promoting a JRPG that's to be released in late-January, it does a good job in that regard. However, as a stand-alone, the episode leaves much to be desired, despite concluding the small-scale story presented within the context of the episode.  
 
Art: 9/10  
This is my second time watching a Ufotable work, the first being the new Fate UBW. The art is rather familiar in regards to UBW - the characters are well-drawn, complemented by very appealing backdrops, from the Castle-in-the-Sky-reminiscent ruins to the cloud-covered landscapes. The last scene of the world following the credits deserves much praise - it really sets up the feeling of the adventure about to begin.  
 
Sound: 8/10 
Epic. Generic? Maybe. The tracks used to compliment the scenes worked well, and that's all that matters in my book. VERY reminiscent of video game music, and with good reason.  
 
Characters: 6/10 
My issues with the characters are the same with the story - there's only 40 minutes of material to observe. While archetypes are present, they aren't expanded upon, given the nature of the length of the episode. Nothing remarkable with the characters, truth be told.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
As a prequel episode so-to-speak promoting the game, I had a good time. The whole episode felt like a fleshed-out opening cutscene for a video game. The action sequences weren't particularly amazing but still kept me watching. The build-up of the setting was fun - as someone who is a sucker for epic-type storytelling, watching this episode was definitely a good time.  
 
Overall: 8/10 
The episode fulfills its role well, given its limitations. I'll definitely be on the lookout for a sequel, should an anime be made from the JRPG. 

          
 
       Helpful Tales of Zestiria follows Sorey and Mikleo as they are adventuring through the ruins of the Shepard in these ruins they stumble across a girl in trouble. 
She doesn't tell them her name later on she is found out to be Alisha Diphda part of a royal knight family. Throughout this series you find out Sorey is the only human in his village, a village full of seraphs. Humans do not belong side Seraphs because they believe humans bring bad things to there village, Sorey is an exception to this because he is far advance from a meer human he can see and hear seraphs which normal humans cannot. At first Alisha thinks he is living alone and is very worried he has been out here all alone for so long, it is interesting seeing her change of heart when she feels like this is a live village. So finally Alisha spills out her name and ends up on the road back to her town, but that's when Sorey realizes a monster that attacked the village was actually after her the whole time. So Sorey and Mikleo set out on an adventure to save her and go to these human towns and cities. This little special was very great its a little sneak peak for the game coming out. I know a lot of people are gonna give it a low rating due to not much happening in it but it is meant to hype up the game give you a little introduction to the game. I really enjoyed it I thought it was very well made and can't wait to get my hands on the game!

(Source: Wikipedia) 
","['Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen']","The Dempa Kyoushi commercials is what the tv anime was supposed to be to be worthwhile. 
 
The first 30 second CM quickly establishes Junichirou's character: a dark room with only the computer monitor as a source of light, nothing but posters and figurines around him while he's rejoicing over something and being obstinate over getting  job. This dorky image set up is just as quickly broken by him asserting his sudden want to become a teacher to help a student prove to a stuck-up twin-tails that her job and passion shouldn't be looked down on. Kagami's values and morals are very evident even with the short time it had. 
 
A big part of what helps sell this rendition of the main character is Daisuke Ono's performance: as much as Hiroshi Kamiya performance of him in the tv anime is good to the point of being the only positive aspect of that adaptation, Ono doing a voice similar to Battler from Umineko fits Junichirou's childish but badass personality fits him perfectly. 
 
That performance is what makes the 2nd commercial lasting only 15 seconds to be so memorable. This moment showcases the main character and the narrative's ethos of ""only doing things you want to do"" which is essentially the series defining scene and payoff to his year of being a teacher. It's obvious only the people who've read the manga will understand the context behind it, but suddenly starting off with Kagami being on a really high roof preaching with a mic helps sell his eccentricity and give a sense that this speech is important.

       Helpful If the parent series was a cake, this OVA would be the topping, and what a sweet topping that was! 
 
- Story (4.0/10): 
Once again, a short animation with no important plot progression, very stereotypical, a bad guy appears and starts stealing women panties, that's where the club's members have to intervene and save the day, but of course not before every woman ever gets violated and Issei has a yet wonderful view. 
Like many other Highschool DxD OVAs, the villain is just as perverted as Issei, and thus, Issei sympathizes with them, saving the day with a yet legendary quote, a mighty pervert has never spoken of before. 
 
- Art (7.5/10): 
With nothing fantastic about it, the same old art style and animation quality spanning this OVA. But at least, you have got to appreciate the physics that only seem to get funky the closer you get to one's chest, oddly enough, works only on female characters. 
 
- Sound (7.0/10): 
Nothing that makes you go “Wow”, I love the outro, the same one from the parent story, however, the second opening theme song hadn't aged quite healthy in my memory. 
 
- Character (5.0/10): 
I would have given this a 4/10, but you gotta have some extra points for the minimalistic screen time for the great Azazel. 
All the characters didn't have anything to add to this episode, aside from getting violated. 
 
- Enjoyment (7.5/10): 
Not the best highschool DxD OVA out there, probably because of the focus on underwear? and like Issei said, it's about what's under the underwear, not specifically them, they are nothing but a support for the magnificent support they provide for. 
 
- Overall (6.2/10): 
I had higher expectations for this OVA, but while not being too terrible, I managed to get some giggles with sometimes spacing out because nothing too interesting was happening. I would recommend watching this, because it's more like a 13th episode for the second season, if you're in for the fanservice, then you're differently going to love this, but if you're like me, a man of culture but also has interest in the plot, you could skip this as it has no ties to the main plot, but skipping an episode might end up in you having some regrets, because one day, you'll finish seeing all of the episodes, and probably want more, but there are no episodes left, so take this chance if you're comfortable, and have fun.

          
 
       Helpful Well... if you happened to have an urgent need for some topless ecchi and don't mind one of the most ridiculous situations yet to come out of the DxD franchise, then by all means check out this OVA. This special focuses on capturing a lingerie thief who happens to be experimenting with forbidden rituals hilariously linked to the philosopher's stone. It's pretty much entirely ecchi with maybe 1% of action thrown in as well. 
 
Animation: 
The animation quality is on par with DxD New, which is to say it's already slightly dated. Lines are a bit blurry and everything is more or less drawn rather than generated. The characters are drawn identically to the parent show and, really, the only difference is the amount of fan-service based ecchi. This pretty much borders on suggestive hentai. 
 
Sound: 
The OVA uses the 2nd OP and ED from DxD New and the BGM, like the parent show, is completely forgettable. They pack a lot of characters into this OVA so expect a majority of the main VA cast to be present in this episode. 
 
Story: 
I pretty much summed it up in the introduction. The story isn't particularly great nor does it add anything to the franchise. The plot here is self-contained with fair rising action, climax, and resolution; but honestly, it's not to be taken seriously as the main focus is to shove breasts in your face. 
 
Character: 
Though we got many cameos here, there isn't any particular development per say, just a lot of different characters screaming as they are fondled, unclothed, or otherwise molested. I had forgotten how much of an open pervert Issei is. 
 
Value: 
Honestly speaking, this OVA perhaps has some entertainment value but otherwise adds very little to the franchise. Unless you find yourself in a desperate need of either DxD or something extremely ecchi yet not hentai, this is probably skippable.

       Helpful I watched Ao no exorcist specials with hopes of finding something funny & entertaining to watch in ""Ao no exorcist""'s style as I liked the series for its humor & I wasn't disappointed. 
 
My advice is to watch these specials if you are a fan of ""Ao no Exorcist""/s comedy.If that is the case then you should watch these specials as they are only 2 minutes long.Although,make sure to watch the main series first.

Their is no real story,just some parts from everyday life of characters & some of their likes & dislikes.So if you want to know more about your favorite character then you should definitely watch it. 
 
Art:- 
 
The art is nice but don't expect anything as great as in the main series since it is not as detailed as in the main series but still it is  not bad for a special.The movements are not as sharp but still nice. 
 
Characters:- 
 
I liked AnE's(Ao no Exorcist) characters.All main & side-characters get at least one episode centered around them & we get to know more about them,either their interests,hobbies or anything else which they either like or dislike.

There are no opening & ending songs.Although the voice-acting is done nicely but still there  is not much to expect in this department.Also,any mame-shiba lovers are welcome~:D

Jean-Ken Johnny, KenKen. The music video was released on the music producer Avex's official YouTube channel and it promotes the anime's image album soundtrack going on sale March 7, 2018--only 5 days after the anime is released.  
",['Music'],"*Note: This song is actually the ending theme for the series. Ignore this note if it has been changed on the MAL synopsis for the page. 
 
_____________________________________________________________ 
 
Finally, the legend himself has made yet another appearance in the realm of anime. Marty friggin' Friedman, one of the instrumental forces behind Dave Mustaine's Megadeth as well as notably Cacophany and a solo career. The man, now a native of Japan since 2003, is also known for multiple collaborations with Japanese bands of multiple genres and covers of anime songs notably with the band Animetal USA with their DBZ and NGE theme's respectively.  
 
As for the other two if many do not know, KenKen is the well known bassist for Japanese alt metal band Rize and having done many collaborations globally. Meanwhile, Jean-Ken Johnny is the lead guitarist and one of the two lead singers for Japanese rock band Man with a Mission (MWAM). The band is noted for its blend of hard rock and dance-pop, as well as each member performing on stage wearing wolf masks.  
 
With that background in mind, one is easily able to see the influence of all three in the song. Powerful lyrics from Jean-ken deliver over a quiet melody that develops into a strong blend of alternate metal with pop influences. To top it all off, we get a killer solo from Friedman only to be blasted back into the song's chorus for the remainder of the music video. 
 
As for the video itself, its as you would expect of an AMV promoting the anime. The quality is nice and reflects that of the actual anime, yet any hint of the plot or characters is left in mystery as it should.  
 
The enjoyment is well received. If you're a fan of the rock scene you'll appreciate this song, with an industry over-saturated with pop and synthesized music in the current year save some notable exceptions. Its a nice change of pace for the anime world, and it sets the mood for the anime that it was produced for.

My opinion? Average, that's all. Would be more, if only it wasn't overshadowed by what it could have been. 
 
This anime had a lot of potential in the beginning, but it was really ruined by several things. One, the characters--despite their unique personalities and quite good voice acting--remained at a distance as they refused to express any adult emotions. Characters who were supposedly in love never kissed or hugged, characters who were married acted the same as when they were children and just good friends, etc. The only two characters who weren't like this were the Hero and the Queen. Furthermore, there was a huge lack of realism and engagement due to the truly stupid use of violence. Characters put tons of other people in danger in refusing to kill, despite the implications that they have no qualms killing, guns were set pieces that people waved around more than anything, and dire scenes were full of inept bumbling and lacked tension completely. The latter half of the series was particularly prone to this. Also, as the series went on, the crazy situation made less and less sense. The final arc presented a complex mystery settup that made no logical sense. Why would you go through all that trouble to assasinate someone instead of just shooting them in the face? Also, (SPOILER) the prince was apparently dead and then--with no explanation as to his miraculous survival from certain death--he reappears.  
 
There were some good parts. The first parts of the series were somewhat enjoyable, before the adventuresome spirit was tarnished by the lack of realism and authentic romance. The animation was fairly good, even if the battle choreography was stiff and unrealistic. The story world  had great breadth and sufficient depth so as to seem complex, and the characters had a great deal of potential for development. If this series were remade under different direction, and several key story point were rewritten to include real violence, actual tension, realistic romance, and remove the gaping holes in the story logic, this would be a masterpiece, easily. But, due to mishandling of an epic nature, the show completely failed to live up to what it could have been.

          
 
       Helpful I had moderate hopes for Allison and Lillia. After all, the novel was written by the same author who wrrote Kino's Journey. Now, I'm not calling Kino's Journey something wonderful. A collection of dark comedies, no matter how good they are, rarely bring anything new to adult audiences. However, most tales in Kino's Jouney are at least thought-provoking to some degrees, and the show has a good and unique atmosphere. Therefore, I thought Allison and Lillia might be another nice little journey for me. Unfortunately it's not the case. 
 
The low production value is the first turn-off for most audiences. The characters all lack moe qualities. The animation is terrible too. What's more disappointing is the fact that throughout the 8 episodes I watched, I haven't even seen one face that is not distorted. I always thought Madhouse was a decent studio, but I don't know what they were thinking when they made this show. 
 
Low production value sometimes can still be saved by good scriptwriting and characterization. Sadly Allison and Lillia has neither. I'm sure that a junior high student can write better scripts than this. Allison tells mini-stories on a 4-episode basis. The first story is about Allison and Will looking for a treasure that can end the war. The story is a little bit interesting at first, but then it gets boring soon after the first episode. Their encounter with that old woman and the death of the old man at the army base brings nothing to the story. The final relevation is also very disappointing. TBH I was expecting much more than a drawing. The second mini-story is even worse. Helping a princess getting her revenge, I mean come on...Sadly the boring plot is not the major problem with the scriptwriting. How the writer resolves crisis is beyond my comprehension: using a watch to block a knife, falling off a tower because a plane flew nearby, and being able to draw a gun and shoot someone when that someone already holds a gun. Allison is filled with this kind of unrealistic details. The characterization is no better either. None of the characters annoy me, but they lack complex emotions and subtle changes that are essential to good characterization. How they acknowledge what goes on around them is also missing. I don't know how good the Lillia part is going to be, but I won't be able to find out since I'm dropping the show.

          
 
       Helpful “It’s a small world” well this one certainly is. Allison & Lillia is an Action, Adventure series set in a world where a war is going on. This anime did have a lot of potential to be a great series but it was let down by its own carefree nature. 
 
The tale of Allison & Lillia is interesting because it is split into 2 separate stories. The first major focus of the story is on the titular character Allison and her childhood friend Wil. Their adventure soon begins when they journey to discover something that could end the war between nations. Even though the meaning behind this WWII-like war was incredibly stupid, at least it gave meaning to the pair’s journey. The only real downside is that it’s resolved surprisingly quickly, which will leave anyone feeling quite unsatisfied. However that’s not the end of this arc-driven story, since it follows a basic structure: establish arc, develop it, climax, rinse then repeat. The second part of the series does the same but focuses on the other titular character Lillia. 
 
The characters involved during these adventures are okay at best but it becomes tiring when so many characters appear to be inter-connected in someway. For the most part they are fairly well-developed, yet from the 2 boisterous female leads to the dull male leads; the cast as a whole leaves very little impression on the viewer. Although what does leave an impression are the farfetched decisions the characters generally make. 
 
At least there’s one positive thing that leaves an impressions and that’s the production value. Sure the animation has its good and bad points, yet the lush environments and character designs (that are quite bland) match the whole WWII theme. Yet CGI similar to the likes of “Last Exile” is to be expected. Well even though this series may not fair so well for some in the animation department, it ends up doing a great job in the sound department by having an amazing soundtrack. The music in the series is up to par with the whole WWII theme and the SFX is certainly impressive. 
 
Overall Allison & Lillia felt like a pretty camp, adventure series with quite a few journeys and quest that are resolved so easily that it proves to be a big disappointment. Sure there are plenty of things to enjoy in this series, like the way the main characters interact with one another and the element of combat, nevertheless with this being such a kid friendly show anything from the combat to the romance will bore anyone who’s used to something… a bit more… intense.

       Helpful This is one of three anime so far which I have given a 10/10 rating. I only give this rating when a show is not only perfect, but expands my horizons with regard to what I think is possible with the medium. 
 
I'd never thought it was possible to relate to an anime so much as I did with WataMote. The few characters that are featured are written with a brutally realistic depth, and the show is the only example of what I might call ""Slice of True Life"". The realistic juxtaposition of narcissism and depression incarnated in Tomoko Kuroki belies a character depth and understanding of humanity usually only displayed by therapists and other psychology professionals. There was never a choice made with regard to the writing that I didn't find believable and, on a fundamental level, correct for the character. Lying to people relentlessly, cheating, mentally insulting strangers, every bit of it was exactly who I was in middle school. The way she is utterly alone in her pain is almost never expressed in anime, but this show treats loneliness like an old friend, joking with it, laughing as it dies inside. This is so much closer to the reality of being a lonely but narcissistic kid. The meta-commentary never ceases to be hilarious, which at first I thought might just be unintentional, but in the beginning of the OVA they pretty much spell out that they understand the metacritical implications of their storywriting. Some people say this show is too cringey, but I usually hate schadenfreude comedy and I love this show. It feels less to me like they're trying to get the audience to laugh at her than it feels like the audience is laughing at her despite the author's wish to engender sympathy, which of course is icing on the metacritical cake. 
 
I could write an essay on WataMote, so I'll stop here. Suffice to say I think this is the best Slice of Life anime ever, and that I'd recommend this anime to absolutely anyone.

          
 
       Helpful I enjoyed Watamote OVA a lot with its creativity and originality. The concept of this OVA has two perspectives in the school rooftop from Aomatsu's (Tomoko's soon to be friend), then Tomoko's, which, in my opinion, was well-handled. I like the new character introductory of Tomoko and Yuu's friend from the middle school and her interaction with Tomoko. I wish we had more interaction with her and the other girls, though but one was good enough.  
 
Aomatsu and Tomoko's meeting on the rooftop was a nice touch despite not seeing face-to-face but, it was nice to see someone actually talking to Tomoko and find her attractive for a change. She's a pretty teenager with a good sense of humor and imagination.  
 
I give the OVA a 10 for everything it stands for. And I hope we will get a second sometime in the future.

19,7518,122,5.079917587,Anime with an ensemble casts,Boku wa Kuma,"A stop motion animation produced by NHK. A colorful children's music video about a clumsy bear, what he is—and is not—and what he likes and dislikes.","['Kids', 'Music', 'Slice of Life']","I'm a sucker for cute animals. When I accidentally stumbled upon the music video Boku Wa Kuma, I was delighted to find that it was about the cuddliest bear I've seen since the Care Bears. While the music video does not offer much in terms of character and story, it's a good waste of two minutes if you want to see a loveable bear do adorable things. 
 
There isn't much of a plot to begin with; it's about an average day in the life of a bear. The problem is the bear's life is pretty mundane and boring – he doesn't do much besides sweep his room and wear buttons for eyes. In fact, the high point of the music video is when he uses milk and orange juice to grow a plant. This is a very easy-to-follow video. The only thing that is any bit confusing is why a baseball falls from the sky and comes crashing into the bear's window. Where did it come from? 
 
Although this music video is short, you learn quite a large amount of important information about the bear. The bear's rival is a fried shrimp. He thinks he was a chocolate in a previous life. He doesn't like to fight. While this crustacean-hating pacifist with a sweet tooth isn't cleaning his room, he's playing his guitar that sounds remarkably like a piano. He's also very easily-entertained and has a broad imagination since at one point he draws himself being scorched by what looks to be Godzilla's long-lost cousin. Make of that what you will.  
 
The music is the best part about the music video. Hikaru Utada's voice is very soothing. However, the lyrics aren't all that great – half the song is the bear singing over and over that he's a bear. No, really? There's also some bad French that was added in the middle of the song for no reason whatsoever. 
 
The whole video is all in stop-motion animation. It was pretty well done, and the bear begs to be hugged to death. The only ugly thing is when his crayon drawings start to move – he can't draw worth a damn. 
 
This is a simple music video for children. If you've had a hard day at school or work and want to relax, or have young siblings, I recommend this video to you. Otherwise, pass it up.

S03 is still unconfirmed. 
 
This special offers highly familiar feel. The glorious OST is here, same with the original style. All characters stay loyal to canon, etc. But the story is lacking, the entire special is completely pointless. Just a bad teaser for 3rd season which may never come. Essentially this is just a lacklustery extra thing you receive on top of the real deal. ""Buy a car and receive a lollipop worth of 5 cents completely free of charge!""

19,6137,124,5.079917587,Anime with an ensemble casts,Tsuki no Waltz,"First ""professional"" animation work by Atsuko Ishizuka of MADHOUSE. It was done and broadcast as an episode of NHK's Minna no Uta.","['Music', 'Kids']","Esta review también está en español. 
 
Tsuki no Waltz, or in english, The Waltz of the Moon, is a song by Mio Isayama, with a video directed by Atsuko Ishizuka (Madhouse), and originally aired in the program Minna no Uta. 
 
In a dark alley with only one street lamp, a red-eyed young girl is admiring a music box. When the music starts, the imaginary (or not?) adventure of our protagonist begins, who will tour dark caves and starry skies, first running and later flying, to finally reach the Palace of the Moon (named Chandra Mahal in the song), where time flows in a different way... 
 
So that's (part of) the story. As for the characters, there are other two, besides our young adventurer: a giant anthropomorphic rabbit with a bored face that will not do much, until he remembers that HE'S the palace (moon and rabbits are closely related in the japanese folklore), and the owner of the music box, an old man with a somewhat scary face that will be the guide of the heroine in the second part of the video, riding a flying crescent moon. 
 
For being Miss Ishizawa's first work, I must say that the result is remarkable. The animation is flawless, very fluid and dynamic. The characters look nice, although a bit simple, with a loosely Ghibli's vibe. And the scenarios are the best part, where the visuals truly shines, presenting a really cool and colorful style: the initial alley, the cave, the palace, and specially the ginormous watch that appears at the end, they all look amazing. 
 
So, the video is pretty.... but what about the song? I must say I found it beautiful. Slow and calm, yet soulful and passionate, Isayama's performance is impeccable.  
 
And the most important part, both music and video work good together. Picture and sound are perfectly synchronized, and the lyrics and the images are related (which is always a plus n_n). 
 
So, Tsuki no Waltz is a great video, both in sound and visuals. I recommend it to those who want to hear a nice song, and be enveloped in a video with fairy tales touches. 
-------- 
Tsuki no Waltz, o en español, El Vals de la Luna, es una canción de Mio Isayama, animado por Atsuko Ishizuka (Madhouse) y originalmente emitido en el programa Minna no Uta. 
 
La historia de este video nos muestra un callejón poco iluminado, en el que una niña pequeña de ojos rojos esta admirando una caja musical. Cuando la música empieza a sonar, comienza la aventura imaginaria (o no?) de nuestra joven protagonista, que recorrerá cavernas oscuras y cielos estrellados, corriendo y luego volando, para finalmente llegar al palacio de la luna (o Chandra Mahal, como lo nombran en la canción), donde el tiempo transcurre de forma distinta... 
 
Aparte de la niña, los otros dos personajes que aparecen en este video son un conejo antromórfico gigante que, hará no mucho más que estar sentado con cara de aburrido hasta recordar que él es el dichoso palacio (la luna y los conejos están muy relacionados en el folclore japonés, como Dragon Ball y Sailor Moon nos enseñaron a los occidentales hace años), y el anciano dueño de la caja de música, que, montado en su medialuna mágica, guiara a la niña en la segunda parte del video n_n.   
 
Para ser el primer trabajo de la señorita Ishizawa, hay que decir que el resultado es notable. La animación es impecable, muy fluida y dinámica. Los personajes se ven bien, aunque algo simples y con un estilo que recuerda levemente al de Ghibli. Es en los  escenarios donde este video brilla, presentando un estilo y un colorido sorprendente: tanto el callejón inicial, la caverna, el tallo gigante, el palacio, la luna, y muy especialmente el relojazo que aparece sobre el final, todo se ve increíble. 
 
Así que el video es bonito... pero y la canción? Tengo que decir que la encontré hermosa. Una canción lenta, tranquila, llena de sentimiento e impecablemente interpretada. Y lo más importante de todo: el video y la música combinan. Imagen y sonido se sincronizan de forma impecable, además de que la letra y el video están relacionados, lo que siempre es un plus. 
 
Así que, Tsuki no Waltz es un gran video a nivel audiovisual, y lo recomiendo a los que quieran escuchar una canción hermosa, y dejarse envolver por un video con toques de cuentos de hadas.

A very traditional styles waltz with a fun rhythm that had that medieval vibe that you'd expect in a fantasy ball. 
 
The art is of a great hand-drawn style that really fits the beauty and he magic of the song.  
Only downside is that dolls creep me out X(

Although the hero, Wataru, wants only to score with Mai, the girl of his dreams, he must first deal with four other young women scattered in his path like land mines. There is infatuated and juvenile Miho, tomboyish athlete Misa, naive Kurumi, and the caustic Satomi, who works in the restaurant where Wataru hangs out and whose personal life become hopelessly intertwined with Wataru's. 
 
The inevitable liaison between Satomi and Wataru sets a new standard in the rendering of animated erotica and may forever change the way animation is viewed in North America.","['Drama', 'Harem', 'Hentai', 'Romance']","First, I would like to say, I was out on the search for a more female audience oriented hentai that featured more consentual acts that didn't have things like x-ray, blood with their virgins, and stuff like that and I more than got that sort of thing. 
 
I also got a hentai which focused heavily on dare I say it, a captain save a hoe style character. He is always there when these women are sad and yeah, he does take advantage of that. But it doesn't feel like it is wrong. He always knows what to say, and what to do, and how to please them. And I really like that. There aren't many hentai like this. I really appreciated the lingering shots on his cum face. Not many hentai do that.  
 
I enjoyed the retro art and animation. I thought it was well done given how old it was. It was certainly better animated than even some later hentai I have seen. Like even some hentai animated ten years later for some reason don't look as good as this to me. Probably do to the highly appealing characters for me.  
 
I very much appreciated the standard breast sizes which were not fetish. I enjoyed the bounces that were ""normal"". I enjoyed things like no xray... no weird cum faces... no blowjob faces... people looked how they should actually look. Everything was very much normal. It was like just a normal story that happened to have sex in it. I appreciated it.  
 
I really want to give bonus points to this hentai because with each episode I wanted more and more to actually have sex. And I did have sex in episode three with my husband to the girl who was tied up. I did appreciate that the protag did not have sex with her like that and waited for her to calm herself before actually screwing her. It was about the nicest girlfriend stealing I ever saw in hentai. lol. He was... very polite. And someone I wanted to fuck to while watching. He was quite sexy for me.  
 
Someday I will have to out together a list of men in hentai I liked a lot. This guy is up there. Sexfriend guy is up there. Junjou Shojou ex Cetera guy is up there. anyway.  
 
Ribbon Chan girl- she was slightly disappointing.  I love ribbon chan girls. I think I loved the fantasy of her more than the actual time with her. Maybe if there is one criticism, it is that I don't think he should have even been able to get with miss princess. lol. It just might have been a better thing. Honestly not sure where my real rating will stand but for now, I just had sex and it felt so good. lol. So I kinda want to score it really high. It did get me in the mood. And most hentai absolutely fail at that task.

A short animation from filmmaker Kihachiro Kawamoto. This film utilizes both stop motion and standard animation techniques.","['Supernatural', 'Historical']","This film is both interesting and not. It's almost like an art piece, a retelling of an old legend. You know exactly what you're getting, and yet, if you approach it with and open mind, I don;t think watching it is a waste of your time. 
 
Story: It's quite simple- love drives people crazy, and ends in suffering - rather appropriate for the religious- Buddhist, focus in this film. You know what you're getting right off the bat, and the character's don't really get development. They're just there as pieces within the simple story. However, the people behind this must be commended for being able to communicate the whole story quite clearly without use of words, smooth animation, or even sound effects throughout most of the film. The story was interesting enough that it just barely kept my attention. The direction, at least was solid, but due to the extremely simple premise, I give it a 6/10- fair. Solid, but nothing special. 
 
Art: The execution of this piece is what really interested me. The stop motion was smooth, and plastic/clay figures meshed surprisingly well with the watercolor backgrounds- it wasn't that good, but it didn't really clash like you'd expect it too. The makers of this pulled off a wide range of characters and faces, and did quite a bit with so little. The animation used some creative techniques for it's time (40 years ago) - characters blinked, moved- range of motion wasn't really impeded by the dated style. Because of the slower animation pace, it was interesting to see directing techniques- zooming in and out, panning, cuts, and so on. 7 out of 10 
 
Sound: There's not much to say about it. There aren't really any sound effects, save for wind noises. The entire track is either silence, or traditional Japanese elevator music (shamisan and taiko drums). That being said, the music and sound DIRECTION is surprisingly good. It raises tension when it needs too, and does it's job. It was kinda surreal, really. 7 out of 10. 
 
Charactesr: There's no development whatsoever really, save for the woman, a little bit. The animators do a good enough job and making characters communicate feelings,and you don't need dialogue to understand them, but all the characters are about as dynamic as the color gray. 3/10 
 
Enjoyment: Overall, it was ok. Perhaps not the best use of 18 minutes and 52 seconds, but certainly not the worst. If you have time to kill, go for it. At very worst, you can use it to put yourself to sleep.

-Attraction like most things in life can have a real powerful pull. Sadly, most attractions are one sided. This is why we have restraining orders and the police to aid us during these troubling times. This anime uses this strong desire to show how with enough devoting any human can change to a troubling beast. 
-Given the strong implied negative it is not a surprise the conclusion would be sad. I am guessing the director was not dissing prayer but saying you can't escape fate or that we are on our alone in life.

The spell fragments imprint themselves onto the skin of various elves. 
 
The trio travels in Ritsuko's tank, searching for elves who might carry the spell fragments so that Celcia can transfer them to her own body and make the spell whole again.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Shounen']","Wow… this is, um, different. It feels that they sort of ripped off Slayers and Lost Universe with the different dimensions that the characters cross over.  
 
Lets talk about the characters, shall we? There is a young high school girl named Ritsuko who seems to have a tank and tons of guns and ammo. How a high school girl gets her hands on a tank, not to mention all the guns and ammo she has, I will never know. Not to mention, she actually knows how to use them well. Her character is a bit duncy and slightly annoying at times because she is a natural high school student with a military fedish. Jumpei is really freaken stupid and does tick me off. I have heard of stupid macho men but he takes the cake. All he seems to care about is food and his high and mighty actress, Airi. He always fights Ritsuko and just… I can’t deal with him. Airi is so high and mighty about being an actress, though she does have a kind side, it just a little off. And yet… it feels like it all works. Even when the tank itself becomes a character, it works pretty well for the comedy that they are trying to keep.  
 
Unfortunately, the ending of season one just feels like a cop out so they can do season 2. Seriously, I just feel they did what they did at the ending to make more money with the second season.  
 
The artwork is lacking a lot. Characters look blocky, animation loops, and a lot of it doesn’t have a lot of textures. Characters also seem to thin. I feel that the animation is some of the weakest that I have seen in a while. It’s sad because I think that it just needs a bit more love in the drawing. It really looks bad, seriously.  
 
The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show. I don’t know but it feels way too serious for what it actually is. I love the dubs script since it adds more comedy in it though it goes off from the original script a lot. The voices on the other hand really fail at times making characters hard to take seriously when they need to be or just plain annoying. Sometimes characters seem to of been given given new voice actors who have no idea how to actually act. Many times they end up yelling way too loudly. They seem more like Bible Black in some aspects but luckily they don’t go into sexual stuff… well, not that badly.  
 
It’s fun to watch, but trust me that it isn’t the best. It’s rather laughable that works with the comedy but they can’t do a serious scene when they really need it. Even though I can’t actually give this a really good rating, its still fun to watch. 


          
 
       Helpful This anime, probably more appropriately titled ""Those Who Strip Elves"", is not horrible or unwatchable. It's just bad. While some of the recurring gags are actually funny, the story is completely contrived and repetitive, and the characters are rather unlikeable. Add annoying opening and closing songs, and the eye cancer that is late '90s anime design, and the end result is the kind of series that one watches because they're bored and have nothing better to see. 
 
The positives here are cartoony violence and seeing the inept characters deal with bizarre situations before they strip the female elf of the week. I don't really care for elves, but if you're into that kind of thing, well, there's plenty of elf nudity to satisfy your desires, as well. If this all doesn't appeal to you though, then don't even bother with this series.

When you grow tired of the same gerne you have been watching over and over again, watch this anime.

(This is my first review, and I am a fan of Assassination Classroom sooo...) 
 
Plot: 
Nagisa, now older, comes to pay a visit towards their old classroom. As he explores the place with nostalgia, he recognizes Karma inside. I must say that it seemed a little rushed to get into that position, and maybe if there was more backstory towards all the others, it would have created much more feels. They find Koro-sensei's graduation book - creating the epilogue/flashback through the whole series. I'm glad that they nailed adding the last, emotional ending, which led me to tear up once again. I wish at least the whole class would have one last reunion to finish off the Assassination Classroom series, as it would make so many fans with tears, although they did show the class photo of 3-E 
 
Character: 
The movie focused more upon the clips within the series, however, I did enjoy those little moments between Nagisa and Karma,  as it felt heartwarming to see their friendship hasn't changed one bit, even if they are apart. 
 
There isn't much I can talk about the art-style and music since it is an epilogue, and they are using clips from the prequels. 
 
Overall: 
Overall, it was a nostalgic trip, and much I would cherish. It just reminds everyone how enjoyable Assassination Classroom was and how much that journey with Koro-sensei really meant for all - the students and the audience. 


          
 
       Helpful Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is a compilation film of the Assassination Classroom TV series. While the film is mostly a compilation, I strongly advise that you finish the whole series before watching this. 
 
There's not much to say about the Art and Sound since it's almost the same with the TV Series. When it comes to enjoyment, I couldn't say that I ""enjoyed"" it since ninjas are cutting onions in the film.  
 
So here's the question: Should you watch it? 
 
Definitely. One thing worth noting is that the film have anime-only epilogue scenes. Unfortunately, many details were left out since the film only has around 90 minutes of run time. I was also hoping for more epilogue scenes, or maybe some adapted scenes from Korotan D (search it if you don't know).  
 
Nevertheless, it still managed to give an emotional impact especially for those who loved the series.

          
 
       Helpful If there was anything most Anime shows are lacking, it's a solid recap to sell a rewatch out. In Ansatsu Kyoshitsu's case, that was exactly it, what you read in the title is what you get. A bittersweet heartwarming refresher that really takes you back. Removing all the meaty mush and exposing you to the highlights of the show, lighting up the part of the story you thought you still remember but have since forgotten about, it almost made it feel like a brand new experience, and in my case, it was far from it. 
 
I really like the fact that they actually put in some work into putting together this recap movie, an hour and a half of pure nostalgic gags and tears, I would say that a solid 85% of the movie was composed of reused shots from the two seasons of the franchise, with the rest being new animated scenes between Nagisa and Karma meeting up again at their old school to honor the memory of their late teacher, no our late teacher, Koro-sensei. As they exchanged greetings, they immediately lost track of time as they started retelling what probably was their best and worse year in retrospect. 
 
As a recap, it was, good, I would say that some scenes would have relatively been better if re-adapted, but it was an enjoyable watch empty of grind or boredom of any sort. Or at least, it was for me.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Shounen', 'Super Power']","I'm gonna say this first off: don't even try to watch this unless you're a big fan of the series, whether it's the 1999 version, the 2011 version, or the manga.  
 
Why? Well, it's more of a 'fan's treasure' if you ask me.  
 
To begin with, the story is the same as the first episode the other two anime (I assume-- at this point, I have only see 2011, though I am planning on watching 1999 soon) but it takes it on in a different way, especially when compared to 2011. The story itself includes more daring escapades compared to 2011, along with more bravery and jarring events.  
 
The art, while grainy (it was another time when this was made) is well done and animated pretty smoothly.  
 
The sound was decent, with the voice actors doing a good job and the background music very fitting.  
 
The character, however, is what makes this a fan's gold mine. We see aspects of these characters we haven't seen before, whether it be Gon's selfishness that reminds others of his father, or perhaps Mito's annoyed love as Gon leaves just like Ging did, or even Leorio's rude comments and new badassery: this OVA covers a lot of things that 2011 didn't touch, making the characters more real, flawed, and deep, even just in half an hour.  
 
Overall, because of the characters especially (and also because I just love HxH) I enjoyed this a lot. 
 
I would recommend this if you: are a Hunter x Hunter fan, like 'collectibles' or vintage things 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: do not like Hunter x Hunter, can't stand grainy or 'old-timey' animation 
 
Have a great day everyone!

          
 
       Helpful So recently I’ve been watching the many versions of what’s often considered Togashi Yoshihiro’s greatest masterpiece: Hunter X Hunter. And so far, I’ve truly been enjoying myself. Without counting the currently ongoing Golden Wind anime, it’s the most fun I’ve had with a Shounen in a long time. So as such, I’ve decided to review each version after I finished watching them (Or in the Manga’s case, whenever it finally ends). So, to start off with let’s start with the second version of the story to ever be released: A pilot episode released in 1998, a whole year before the first anime series started and only a few months after the Manga started being released. So let’s see how this first attempt turned out. 
 
Story: 
 
The pilot adapts the first two chapters of the manga (Which would be the first and third episodes of the 1999 Version and the first episode of the 2011 Version). Given that this is adapting so little, it stands to reason that this Pilot doesn’t have much going for it, if anything it’s kinda bare bones, which is its biggest issue. 
 
That said, I do feel there’s enough in this one episode to make it worth watching. Something I loved about this series is the feeling of adventure and the unknown, which this version flawlessly showcases, arguably even in a better way than all other versions did in their first episodes. We see Gon go through a challenge in it of itself to be allowed to leave the island, and then he goes off to meet new people and encounter strange creatures. 
 
Also, unlike the 2011 Version, it doesn’t forget that Kite (Or is it Kaito? I’ve honestly seen it spelled both ways) actually exists. His scene is also adapted well enough, you get the gist of him, what he means to Gon, and then he leaves. It’s not much, but its more or less the same as in the manga. 
 
Characters: 
 
Since this is only what should be a first episode, you get introduced to our main trio but not much else. This is fine, of course. All of these characters show that there’s more behind them than what they seem to have, and they all come off as likable. Gon is appropriately energetic, Kurapika is calm and sometimes cold, but also honorable and kindhearted, and Leorio is a total goofball. Again, not much here, but for what it’s worth, it does work. 
 
Animation: 
 
Overall this Episode looks okay. It’s looks better than the Manga version of these events for sure (Those early chapters looked as if they were barely finished) but unlike the other two Animes, nothing really stands out. It isn’t dark and almost gothic like the 1999 Version, nor is it bright and colourful to make the darker scenes hit harder like the 2011 Version. It tries to strike a balance, which honestly just makes this version blend in with all the other Shounen Animes. That said, this Pilot does include a giant kraken thing that I’m pretty sure never appears in the Manga but honestly I can totally buy as a Togashi creation. 
 
Sound: 
 
Similarly the soundtrack doesn’t really stand out. It’s not bad or anything, but there’s not much here either. It’s just sorta there for me. 
 
Voice Acting:  
 
This is the first of our three casts, and I like it. Matsumoto Rica steps up as Gon and is the right level of childish and immature without getting annoying. Canna Nobutoshi was spot on as Leorio, being the right level of annoying while still greedy yet kind-hearted. Hidaka Noriko stands out as the least notable of the three. Not so much because she’s bad, but rather that she doesn’t really stand out. She’s definitely my least favorite of Kurapika’s three Seiyuus. To round of the rest of the cast, we have Okomura Akemi, Nakahara Shigeru and Utsumi Kenji (Who would ironically reprise his role in the 2011 Version). 
 
Overall: 
 
I know this review was short, but that’s because there just isn’t much to talk about here. Overall, it’s a fun pilot that isn’t anything special, but I do overall like it. I would’ve honestly liked to see how this version of the story continued, but as it is it’s perfectly fine. If you wanna give Hunter X Hunter a chance, then this is probably the best place to start. 
 
Final Score: 7/10

          
 
       Helpful This stand-alone OVA of Hunter x Hunter, which is the prologue of the 1999 television series, offers a little insight into Gon's childhood and why he decides to become a Hunter. This OVA is a slight shift from the starting of the Hunter x Hunter series, where Gon, Kurapika and Leorio are on their way to become successful Hunters. While on their journey to give the Hunter Examination which is notorious for its low ratio success rate, the three characters are attacked by a giant octopus-type monster. This episode shows us the little fight that happens before the great adventure of the trio in the world of Hunter x Hunter begins. There's also a scene at the start of the episode where little Gon is saved by Kite as he's being attacked by a wild foxbear. Although it only lasts for a while, it was good to relive the moment that plays a pivotal role in the future Hunter x Hunter series.  
 
This episode came on 1998, before the production of the Hunter x Hunter TV show began so there's little I'll complain about the artwork which is below par, but watchable. The same applies for the background music, insert tunes and voice acting in this show. Although you won't miss out on anything important if you miss this OVA, but if you're planning on starting either the 1999 or 2011 TV series then this Pilot OVA is a good little watch.

It's a sketch type of thing.

Besides, most of the lovable characters of the series don't even make an appearance here.

Nothing else has been announced.,"['Action', 'Fantasy']","If you never play the game, DO NOT watch this for the story starts in the middle part of the game story. I do write a small synopsis before the events on the very last paragraph. 
 
The first thing I want to comment is the art. I surprisingly very pleased with the design and animation. I thought it would look not as good as the pictures, but each character is very amazingly created to life. Of course, not all characters made it into the anime but still, it is understandable. 
 
I was also shocked how the voices are pretty good, considering it's a Korean anime. If you never watch Korean drama/movie/songs/cartoons, you may feel a bit odd hearing it. But since Elsword itself is made by Korea, of course the anime most likely to have Korean voice. 
 
I am pretty disappointed of how everyone except Lu & Ciel are shown in their special class. Each character's chosen class for this anime if very fitting along with their background. I do wish they also give Lu and Ciel's appearance in their special class, which I most likely think its going to be Noblesse. Maybe its just me, but even seeing them fight makes my heart says that LuCiel are ""weak"" for they are not in their chosen paths while others have. If you play the game you might understand me. 
 
Now, for the small synopsis. BEWARE SOME SPOILERS THOUGH. 
 
The anime itself starts in the middle of Hamel arc and continues until Lanox arc. Not surprised since that's where most characters finally gathered, excluding Rose and Ain. 
 
Elsword is a boy who trains sword. At first, its only him, Aisha and Rena who travels Elrios for the El. They are called El Search Party. In the early Altera arc, they met Raven who joined them and Eve in the end of Altera arc. They soon meet Elesis and they goes on until Hamel which where the story begins. Just play the game in my suggestion~

          
 
       Helpful Yeah give an anime adaptation of an MMO and start it past the mid point of the game's plot...BRILLIANT!!!!!! 
 
Ok, so sarcasm aside, Elsword is an anime LA didn't even expected to get an anime and LA being a rather early fan of Elsword and played the game for hundreds of hours but had fallen off it (Computer issues) much later, LA still liked this grindfest of an MMO. 
 
So how does the anime stand to the MMO?...well... 
 
The most bizarre thing about this anime is that it starts the anime at the mid-point (start of Hamel to be precise) with the all of the El Party members having already grown to their 2nd Job Classes, so this is telling that this is for the fans however it utterly isolates the newbies wanting to get into this MMO through the anime in the first place, it's just a weird choice even starting here where it did. The only point LA thinks to defend this decision is that Elsword wanted to get into the action quickly thus chose a pretty heavy story-centric point of the story with the majority of the cast being complete aside from four that later joins. But nonetheless seeing many of Elsword's more action-packed events happen in animated form is a pretty good trade off.  
 
Character-wise we have our typical character tropes we usually see in their job orientated MMO's. Elsword is the hot-blooded dense guy, Aisha is the tsundere, Raven is the brooding emo, Rena is the mature one, Eve is the kuudere, Chung is the nice guy heavy and Elesis is the leader and LA's favourite character of this anime (and by extension was LA's main in the actual game), the thing is for the most part, characters isn't what drive the plot, it's the ""next goal"" and the more obvious ""save the world"" plot cliche. The only ones to get some sense of character development are Elsword and Ignia with the link being wanting to save people, just HOW they do it becomes conflict to the two of them, Elsword himself also gets a dilemma with betrayal as to how too kind-hearted he is. Chung and Ara gets one if only because of their family members being brought over to the demon side and how they try to get over it in some cases, finally Add gets one of him not being a jerk to the rest of the El Party, the rest of the main cast well uhhh...well your gonna be out of luck. Overall, character development wise due to the rather big main cast roster, it's rather all over the place, as again it's more plot-driven than a character driven narrative. 
 
The main point of this anime is yes an advertisement to the MMO and everything but it kinda brings the MMO to an animated form and it did it's job all things considering, bringing references, shipping characters (seriously the shipping moments in this anime is outrageous, it's almost blatantly tongue and cheek about it) and elements to the game brought to life and telling a rather simple story of good vs. evil (ohh come on...it is simple!, a detriment to the game as well mainly because we have a party of good guys wanting to kill the demons and save Elrios, basic goal is this, being honest here. If we're speaking world lore that's different but what the anime gives us...then yes it's simple.)  
 
In terms of animation done by DR Movie did a pretty great job, from the crisp character designs, good backgrounding and the even better battles shown is greatly detailed. If there is one other reason to watch Elsword besides being a fan of the game, is that the animation is GORGEOUS or AMAZING to look at..this coming from a Korean studio in the first place!, however as detailed as most of the animation gets, it does get shoddy at times with blatant slips of quality here and there for the most part are rare, but still animation is gorgeous or amazing when it does want to be. 
 
The thing is for voice acting, LA has some experience in the Korean voice acting (as in LA has heard it quite often in childhood) and from this LA will say that Koreans have a thing to over exaggerate their vocal inflictions in a cartoony way in comparison to Japanese where it's more refined and professional. Now is LA saying the Korean voice acting is terrible, ABSOLUTELY NOT, the Korean voice actors fit into their characters well and for the most part is great, what LA is merely saying is that with LA's experience with the Korean language and everything it's just something LA picked up while watching this anime and there will obviously be a disparity to Korean and Japanese voice actors in the long run of things. Overall decent Korean voice acting which ""kinda"" got annoying with some squeaky vocals here and there...*cough* Ara and Aisha *cough*. 
 
Elsword's anime by it's definition is an advertisement for the MMO and though with a bizarre plot choice, varying character developments in which your favorite character ""might"" get shafted as a satellite character (no seriously), great technical aspects from the voice acting and animation and bringing in references and elements of the game in subtle ways, LA thinks this ""advertisement"" of an MMO was done is a decent way, problems yes, but nonetheless since LA was a fan of the game LA might have some bias towards this franchise. But still even with it's faults, Elsword the Animation for an MMO anime adaptation was handled properly, not the best adaptation LA has ever seen but is a decent watch nonetheless.

          
 
       Helpful Well I never played elsword, I'll give my opinion about this about the animation 
Beginning with the Korean animation, well it is with excellent quality the expressions and gestures of the characters are very natural 
The story is based on a group of ""Heroes"" who help themselves and face monsters, I really enjoyed the interaction between them 
I do not know much about the game but I think it's based on ""Lore"" 
 
If you like fantasy animes, basically ""games"" can be up to a great choice depends on the point of view of each, the story has a fairly ""basic"" development and aspect of games, catch mission, reach the place, kill monsters .

       Helpful Just for everyone to know: 
1. It's NON-CANON 
2. It's a PROMOTIONAL anime for Dragon Ball Heroes, so don't expect every week 20 minute episodes that are perfect  
3. Be happy that they will bring us thing Akira would probably never give us (such as ssj3 trunks and such) 
4. Just look at it as if it's a fan-service-only anime... so don't expect perfect quality 
 
It's not that I accept this all, of course I would want 20 minute episodes, but we can't change it from a promotional anime to a full-running anime like Dragon Ball used to be by writing hate reviews or being hateful to the makers of this anime. 
And to the people saying this anime is a waste of time, they also always complain about them being too short, or that it takes too long to publish another episode. If you don't want to wait for the next episode, then do things that are more important like an actual job, instead of writing reviews about hating the series. 
Besides that I do agree that the story isn't 'interesting' yet, and it lacks logics of the power between characters, but it was already messed up in DBS anyways.  
At least they don't rush things the first 6 episodes like DBS did with awful animation...  
 
This is not to be hating on the haters, but I'm just pointing out some obvious things. This is nothing to anybody personal, but I just see way too many over the top hate reviews on the series.

Super Dragon Ball Heroes - SO IF ANYONE WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE DRAGON BALL HEROES ISN’T A THING, GUESS AGAIN, HERE WE ARE WITH AN ANIME INSTEAD OF 1 MINUTE PROMOTION. 
 
For real though, I have nothing against the game nor the premise per say. What I am asking is this: Really? You think your fanbase is so addictive to your IP that they just can’t wait less than a year to get new content? You really want to milk Dragonball so bad that we need filler content just so that your audience doesn’t forget about it? 
 
This anime is one of those original net animation from Toei, which is basically Toei way of releasing their content very cheaply.  
 
What I am saying is that this anime is cheap as it comes with very underwhelming character interaction. You know how the people outside the fandom think Dragon Ball is? Just fight after fight with no thought outside of presenting the fight themselves? Well this anime is simply that. You get some fights and that's it. But of course we have a story to tell. 
 
Dragon Ball Heroes or Super Dragon Ball Heroes takes place some time after Super Dragon Ball has ended with Goku and Vegeta training with Whis once more. But uh oh! A new evil looking glasses character shows up and tells that his ‘friend’ Future Trunks has been captured in prison planet! I personally would call it planet less a dank place and more a planet with giant ass chains, but I digress.  
 
And from here on out we meet some characters which our heroes are thrown to and we get to see more fanservice. How come they are here? Well there are many reasons for each characters to be here, but to summarize it, it's because of Money and Fuck You. I believe that there are some people who want to see Golden Not-Freeza in all his might, but I doubt that it was Toei top priorities to make your wish come true. 
 
So about what I said earlier regarding how this show is just fights after another. I wouldn’t call this a bad thing per say. Considering how this is Dragon ball, you could make this the best feature by having the characters adapt the situation of their unique enemy. This is what most of the Dragon ball movies and special tried to do. The keyword was tried. Here the fights are just boring to watch. There is no weight behind each battle, nor any flashy animations that would make this at least look nice. 
 
To give you an example, watching these fights are like going to a fast food restaurant and only ordering fries from the menu after another. It's gives you a kick at first, it then start to tastes the same, and then you wish you had added something more. 
 
You might say this is just to be a promotional anime for the game, but we already have the commercials for it, and ton of them, so… what? 
 
I also most congratulate Toei animation. You somehow made it boring to watch Goku Goku action. I-I-I just can’t believe you actually rushed that fight. You even made fusion, freaking fusion something that lacks all of it excitement. Hmmm, maybe if you actually had some stakes or at least had some fun it might would had been enduring. Since serious Dragon ball nowadays is something that would not work due to how the series never gonna permanently remove any important characters, I was hoping that this would rather be comedic Dragon Ball. Alas, this wasn't a comedic entry.  
 
Okay but what about the NEW characters? We have evil glasses guy, Fuu, he's… eh. We have not-Broly/Raditz, he’s a saiyan, he's… eh. I can’t remember his name. I'm not joking, I know he's named after a vegetable, has the power to control people and turn into a giant ape, but he's freaking name wasn't even important to remember. Hell I remember his voice actors name more than his. You know, the more of these saiyans appear on screen, the more I appreciate Freezas genocide. I mean Jesus Fucking Space Christ, how many non trained saiyans were there to be over a thousands times stronger than Goku in this multiverse? 
 
There is one thing that makes this anime belong so far low on the list. Even if this anime is average at best, there's this attitude Toei has. Toei made this when we were going to have a arguably better Dragon Ball product very soon. Like guys, don't you think that you should spend these resources on the movie and not on an animated advertisement?  
 
This isn't strange for Toei to go all out on their current main IPs. Yet I also haft to ask this; why the fuck couldn't you spent this amount of resources on doing mini series for your other older IPs? You know, those others who are or had anniversaries? How about Sally the Witch? Fist of The North Star? Cutie Honey? Hell Teacher Nūbē? Or even Kinnikuman? You could do every episode on Kinnikuman day. Or even better, MAKE A GODDAMN CARTOON ABOUT YOUR MASCOT! IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS! But I will talk about that another time. Oooh do I have plans for it. 
 
As for this, eh. I got not much else to say about this show. It's a online video series made by Toei, what kind of quality did you expect? You get some good voice acting from the series standards and the newcomers seems to be doing a good job, but else seems to bland. 
 
If you want to watch Dragon Ball Heroes, just watch the commercials or play the game. You could skip this one okay. You ain't missing much from this. Honestly.

The movie's version of bloopers was pretty awesome just because you got to see the Generation of Miracles being funny together, which is something new. For example, there's a blooper with Kise and Aomine that I love. 
 
Obviously, there's no character development or anything that benefits the story, but it does lighten up some of the more intense moments of the anime, so it's nice to be able to let go of some of that tension.

19,11809,138,4.922281539,Anime with an ensemble casts,gdgd Fairies,"gdgd Fairies is a short animation about a trio of fairies who live in the Forest of Fairies, and whatever trivial and queer subjects they decide to ramble about.",['Comedy'],"gdgd Faeries is a bizarre comedy. In the sense that I couldn't find a Studio listed for it. It was directed by Sugahara Souta, who's done some stuff I've never heard of & written by Ishidate Koutarou, who has also done some work on things I've never heard of. I have no idea what to expect, so let's dive right in. 
 
Story: 
 
We follow three faeries, Pikupiku, Shirushiru & Korokoro as they boldly hang around a forest and chat. There are four basic types of gags in this anime. In the first, the three faeries sit around a stump with tea and just have strange comedic conversations on random topics. In the second, they go to the hyperbolic time chamber... I mean “room of mental and time” which resembles but is legally distinct from the similar area of empty space from Dragonball. In this room they basically play around with magic in absurd ways. The third type of comedy we get is the faeries gathering around a magic pool that let's them see into other worlds. And then the actresses ad lib responses to the random CG videos they're shown. The final type of gag comes with the next episode previews. Basically, instead of doing an actual preview they parody some other anime. 
 
The comedy in this tends to be of the really rapid fire variety. Whatever's happening on screen, the japes come out at a pretty continuous pace. The comedy is also very hit and miss. When it's working, it's amusing enough but when it doesn't work it drags. During the conversation segments, for example, they might just ramble about something that isn't funny but you can tell they're trying to have some punchlines in there. The saving grace, when that happens, tends to be Koro coming in and just derailing the whole thing with a comedic non sequitur. You might get four minutes of a kind of boring conversation before that happens but it's something. The magic practice suffers a slightly different hang up. In those segments, they like to have more elaborate set ups leading to bizarre outcomes. The problem is that sometimes they just go on with one beyond the point where there was any good material for it. There are other times that the jokes end up being pretty obvious which isn't something you want in comedy that heavily relies on absurdity. The ad-libbed segments are actually my favourites. The actresses are quite clever at coming up with things to dub over the videos with. They're also clearly having a good time doing it and their cheer is more than a little infectious. 
 
Characters: 
 
This is one of those comedies where the characters are very simple but they complement one another pretty well and there are plenty of comedic opportunities to explore with their interactions. Which is good since this anime is mostly spent on the interactions. 
 
Art: 
 
There's no denying that this anime is pretty damn ugly. The CG looks like something you'd find from a particularly lazy Newgrounds animator. I thought Kemono Friends looked kind of bad, but compared to this it looks pretty decent. At least that series had more movement and more varied backgrounds. Then again, it probably wouldn't be practical to have the ad-libbed scenes in a work that put things like time & effort into the animation. So, maybe it's worth looking like they could have bought a single pack of gum if they used the entire animation budget. 
 
Sound: 
 
The main actresses of this give some good performances and not just with their improvisation skills. We've got Akesaka Satomi, Mizuhara Kaoru & Mimori Suzuko. The music is... it's okay. It's not a soundtrack you're likely to listen to outside of watching the anime but it serves its purpose. 
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There really isn't any. None of the conversations the trio have ever indicate anything that might be beyond friendship. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
So, that's gdgd Faeries. Overall, it's a series that looks pretty shit but it's not bad at all. It has its funny moments and both the characters and actresses work off of each other well. Is it one of the funniest anime you'll ever see? No. It's not an uproariously funny anime in general, to be honest. It's more one where the comedy is enjoyable and you can chuckle at it, when it works. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If it sounds like it could be your type of humour, I'd encourage you to try an episode or two. It may well work for you better than it did for me. Next Week I'll look at Twilight Q, no relation to a certain notorious book series.

          
 
       Helpful Comedy in anime can feel tired at times. Even the best series the genre has to offer will sometimes fall back on tropes that have been done a thousand times, whether in parodying them or outright playing them straight faced. That's not to say comedy anime is bad for this reason (it's one of my favorite genres), but sometimes the idea of watching a series completely out of left field in its comedy and presentation can feel refreshing and be a nice break from the same old stuff. 
 
And this is why I love gdgd Fairies, a show that has legitimately made me laugh out loud harder and more frequently than any other anime series out there. The simple episode structure, excellently crafted jokes, unique visual style, likable characters, and overall fun atmosphere of this series work towards my considering gdgd Fairies a 10/10 show, meaning I love it on every conceivable level, which I will discuss here. 
 
Each twelve minute episode of gdgd Fairies follows a three-part formula: the opening conversation bit, the Room of Spirit and Time, and the Dubbing Lake. The show follows pretty closely to this structure, though there may be an episode or two where one segment is cut out to make room for another one to be longer, and the final episode is completely fucking insane and does not follow the structure at all: you are not prepared for the final episode of season 1 of gdgd Fairies. 
 
A typical episode of gdgd Fairies starts with the three main characters—the innocently dumb pkpk, quiet and mysterious krkr, and the more extroverted and cheeky shrshr—sitting around a table, drinking tea, and talking about some mundane topic, such as sleeping, sneezing, etc. While these conversations usually start in a reasonable place, they inevitably spiral out of control into hilariously imagined scenarios, which are visualized by the bizarre cast of background characters (which I will discuss later). 
 
While the scenarios in these segments are funny in their own right, what really sells them is the chemistry of the characters. Despite being in a “cheap kids show”, the three main fairies are all adorable and lovable, each with a distinct yet realistic personality (none of the characters have gimmicks—they're all just dumb kids that feel real, not gag characters). Much like in a show like Lucky Star or K-On where a lot of the appeal is watching cute, authentic characters interacting with each other, pkpk, krkr, and shrshr are always a joy to watch on screen together, with dynamics that feel more realistic than many other more gag-oriented comedies. 
 
The second segment of an episode of gdgd Fairies sees the three characters go into the “Room of Spirit and Time”, where their magical powers are greatly enhanced, allowing them to play batshit, absurd games that often reach massive scale. The scenarios presented in the first segment may be out there, the absurdist humor is pushed even farther in this segment, with some of the most unforgettable scenes in any comedy anime out there (shrshr launching herself out of a cannon to knock down over 600 old men stands out in my mind). 
 
And finally, an episode of gdgd Fairies ends with the Dubbing Lake—a segment where the three fairies watch a short, silent, and strange clip and then make dialog based on what is happening in the clip. These scenes are often the funniest and some of the most memorable of the show, as the dialog here is actually improvised by the voice actresses themselves. 
 
Watching the voice actresses fall in and out of character, playfully jab at each other's good or bad attempts at comedy, and often make genuinely gut-busting dialog makes the whole show feel like it was fun to make and work on in a way no other anime can. The voice actresses themselves almost feel like characters themselves, and learning about their own unique personalities and habits inform how we perceive the characters they portray. This extra bit of metanarrative makes the experience feel completely unlike any other anime out there (well, I say “unlike any other anime out there”, but there have been other series in this vein that have tried the same style of voice actresses improvising, like Straight Title Robot Anime and Tesagure Bukatsumono, but to a much lesser effect—I did not find either of these anime to be nearly as engaging as gdgd Fairies). 
 
Now, if you've even looked at the poster for this show, you're probably thinking that there is one glaring aspect to this anime that I have yet to talk about in depth, and that is the way this show looks. Yes, gdgd Fairies is a low-budget CG kids show, but the fact that it is a cheap-looking CG show is part of what sells it so hard for me.  
 
A lot of the comedy of gdgd Fairies is absurd, surreal, and just fucking weird, and the uncanny and unconventional artstyle of the show is able to capture the insanity of what is happening on screen better than any more traditionally styled show. While the main girls all manage to be adorable moe characters in their own unique ways, the “background characters” (stand-ins during games, “actors” in the Dubbing Lake, etc.) are all weirdly realistic looking, and the contrast between these real-ass looking people in their weird-ass situations makes the comedy that much funnier. Watching shrshr mow down 600 anime-looking old men is not as distinct and instantly memorable as watching her mow down 600 realistic old men. Absurdist comedy anime like Nichijou are funny in their own ways, sure, but there's just something about the contrasting, uncanny visuals of gdgd Fairies that really stands out to me. 
 
Overall, gdgd Fairies is a unique anime that I love in every way. Sometimes anim can feel monotonous in terms of its visuals and content, and gdgd Fairies just exists in its own little bubble that feels untouched by anything else anime has ever tried to do. It's its own beast, and whether you absolutely love it like I do or just find it weird and offputting, I definitely think checking this show out worthwhile, just for the novelty of it. There is no other comedy anime out there that I have found to be so consistently funny, creative, and unique. It feels like gdgd Fairies has a goal in mind—to be an insane, absurdist clusterfuck of a comedy series that will leave you completely baffled by what is happening on screen, but not at the cost of sacrificing fun likable characters or solid comedy—and not only accomplishes it, but goes even further to add little details that aren't needed and metahumor and 4th wall breaking character depth.  
 
If you are in the market for an original, hilarious comedy anime, definitely give this one a watch. 
 
(note: I've given the Story a 10 and Sound an 8, but I'm equating story to content and therefore comedy and including voice acting in sound because the score is nonexistent, or at least I never noticed because it's not really necessary to fully enjoy this show.

          
 
       Helpful Holy crap! I mean who thought that an anime with poor CG graphics, bland setting straight out of saturday mornings girls' cartoon and an animation studio nobody has ever heard of, could actually be kinda... good? 
 
In my case, it all begun with a youtube video ""Piku Shiru Can't Stop"", which is a mash-up of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song and gdgd Fairies. I found it strangely entertaining and annoying at the same, and after a while I noticed that the 2nd season was among the on-going series. I watched some random episode and was pleasantly surprised how amusing it was, and right after got hooked on the 1st season. 
 
To make it clear, this is no My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic kinda series that was targeted to little girls, but somehow grown men got around watching it. Gdgd fairies' forte is the constant flood of references and humour, most of which younger audiences wouldn't get in all its Japanese weirdness. 
 
Most episodes go by the same formula: The opening, sitting around a table chatting (plenty with sit-com humour and tsukkomi), the room of might and magic (I think it was called something like that), where the fairies e.g. invent new sports such as bungee jumping from space and trying to catch a bread roll with your mouth at the same time. This represents the more physical and weird type humour much like the one you see in Monty Python. 
 
Then there's also the magic spring that serves as a Teletubbie Screen that shows us another worlds that bear frightening similarities to Garry's mod videos. Then the seiyuus try to improvise and dub over these videos of naked old men soaring through the sky. This is literally improvising so the characters' ways of speech chages notably. The voice actors do a great job. 
 
Finally, after the ED, is the next episode's preview, which actually is just a spoof of some popular anime such as Haruhi, Higurashi or Oreimo. It's way too easy to miss these, considering the relatively high entertainment value they have. 
 
 
Overall, this is a better anime that anyone could reasonably expect. It's strange and funny as hell, but the animation is nothing to speak about and storyline non-existent. Many will definitely think gdgd fairies is just plain awful, but as many or more willl find it strangely addicting. Just watch some random episode like I did and find out.

We got a new song that was as good as the songs in the main serie. This song was playing during the recap feel like part. 
 
There isn't anything to talk about with this one. Those who watched the parent show should watch it, because it's short and had the same energy as the other one.

          
 
       Helpful Short little special inserted after the performance in ep13 of tari tari and runs in parallel time until the ending. Probably worth watching if you like Tari tari. 
 
Random personal rambling: I think i watched the tv series in 2013 and its quite an weird experience going back to this after 3 years. Makes me wonder why they bother making such a short after the anime's been done for quite a while. The short gets quite sentimental and reiterates the bittersweetness of graduation and parting ways, and it makes me wonder if I would've gotten sad had i watched it back then or perhaps that effect works better after the fact. Because, I was in university back then, and now I don't keep in touch with the friends i had back then i anymore, so in a way the timing in which I watched this short with 2 different perspectives time fits more appropriately.

Japan attacked Peal Harbor and felt the need to instill in children such an achievement, perhaps even brainwash them into celebrating the Empire's actions overseas. What next? They hire a leftist artist to direct a pro-war propaganda animated movie. Sounds good? Unworried about the future, the military rejoiced over a rather unimpressive final product. Seo most definitely felt bad about all this, meaning his efforts towards the film's realization must have been the bare minimum. He'd still direct a sequel before Hiroshima's bombing. The government never thought for a second that they could lose the war, that all this pathetic pretentiousness would be glued on the wall of shame for future generations to contemplate. And it is not even good. Even the most morally questionable projects from Disney and Warner Bros. still had beauty resulting from the hard work of artists whose ideologies didn't interfere with their skill. Momotarou no Umiwashi is a bad movie no matter how you look at it. Not denying its historical importance, which comes down to Tezuka being inspired, but it aged horribly, both technically and conceptually. Check it out to laugh at the Army's conceit which in turn led to their demise.

I've always loved the works from both Yuusuke Nakamura and Asian Kung-Fu Generation and love whenever we get to see an animated collaboration. 
 
Seeing different directors playing around with Nakamura's distinct art style is a treat to behold. While it doesn't strive to change the world, the small and self-contained energy it possess makes it worth sharing and worth discussing. Its vibrant colors and Nakamura's visual signifiers of vibrant colors sitting alone alongside empty white space as well as his integrations of animals and human characters make the visuals interesting and let you know exactly who he is as an artist. 
 
Since something as simple and short as a music video doesn't exactly require a review as most people who come across this page will likely look at the score to decide if the video is worth 5 minutes of their time or not. However, I believe that short things like this are worth remembering and worth discussing as art. Regardless of ambition, this is a rare animated work coming from excellent creators and I wish that there was more of it.  
 
Great song, great video, easy watch.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Atarashii Sekai is an amazing sound.  The sound has more of a ""pop/rock"" sound compared to that of the earlier works of Asian Kung-Fu Generation, but it's defietley amazing.  The song itself is a very fast pace, up-beat song that gets you moving and excited when listening to it.  It is a very original song that has both meaning and melody to it while continuing at a fast pace through out the entire song.  The music video makes it that much better.  The music video, like the majority of Ajikans PVs are very original and fun to watch.  Though, unlike their earlier PVs, the PV to Atarashii Sekai is fully animated.  The art work is very colorful, and extremely unique and the artist who drew the art work is amazing.  This is definely a must listen/see to any Ajikan fan who has not heard or seen it before.  The music video is amazing to watch, and the song will make you want to get up and dance, though you will try to resist the urge in order to finish watching the amazing music video that represents it. 
 
If you have not seen the PV nor listened to the song, I suggest you go do that now.  It's definetly worth it.

          
 
       Helpful Normally when you think music video, most of the time you don't think of something extraordinarily good. However after watching Atarashii Sekai, I have to say I was more impressed with this music video than a lot of others I have seen.  
 
  Atarashii Sekai is a song by the Rock band Asian Kung-Fu Generation. And with this amazing song came a trippy yet beautifully animated music video.  
 
 I'm a fan of rock music myself so I may be biased when I say this but the song is awesome. It doesn't sound overly auto tuned and I love the guitar work in it very well done.  
 
 The visuals were amazing, the art style was fantastic with excellent use of color though at some points the animation would bug out and that would be unpleasant to the eyes. 
 
 Story and characters are irrelevant considering it's a music video.  
 
 In conclusion if you like rock you should definitely check it out because this music video is very well done.

(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)","['Action', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Jayanti's history lesson will now commence and how Machine Robo: Butchigiri Battle Hackers came to be that anime of the year. Please enjoy the story. This was back in 1987 before there were any real technology. Thinking about the past, it was treacherous. In a small part in Asia, I was about to leave the country. There was no passport control, it was a isolated town where merchants did trade. The main port was overcrowded, everyone was desperate trying to get out. The only access in and out of the town were the boats the town provided. Outsiders would drive the boats out the town and Incomers would take those boats and drive back into the city. Sometimes it would take days for a boat to come back where you just stand until it comes. I could hear the daily market bustling as everyone waited in line to get out. Unfortunately, the Port was shaped in a ""E"" (E shape) with 3 docks. I was at the front of the line, at the 1st dock. When the boats started to come, they parked at the 2nd dock and 3rd dock, totally letting those people cut in line. This was how flawed the system was. When the last boat of the day came, I yelled at the guy to park at the 1st dock. And I finally got a boat for me to get out. But then that was just the easy part. I had to climb a rope ladder down from the port onto the boat that was shaking from the choppy waves. Before I was about to drive out, the guy behind me in line tossed me something, it was the Machine Robo anime DVD. He said it was a gift for me. Naturally I thanked him, and that's how I went home to watch this anime. The anime is very good. The mechas got cool style, some with sunglasses. And I promise you will see the mecha in the front cover. It was very good mecha, I think Ganbaruger was better, but Machine Robo be brawling. One of the mecha got that long thick spinning drill on his arm as a weapon and he smashes through walls. I showed this to my European friend and he cried after watching the ending. He was touched and left in tears, all emotional that it ended. I had to satisfy him, by showing him Ganbaruger. Don't worry everyone who's like my European friend. You will receive the same enjoyment from this anime like from the passage I've written.

Part of the anime is him as a child, and part is of him as an adult.","['Sports', 'Shounen']","*Review 2.0 on this series, my first review was rushed* 
 
Musashi no ken, I remember when I first wanted to watch this series back in 2007. At the time there were two options available. Either A) buy the R2 (for a grand total of over $600 USD) or B) get the RAW&rsquo;s from some online torrent (which I might add didn&rsquo;t exist) and wing it. Well Option A was out of the question (way to poor as your run of the mill college student to pay for that, let alone DVDs without subs.. ) Well, Fast-forward to November 2008 when I happened to locate a greatly priced box set of the series, with.. you guessed it.. subs! Couldn&rsquo;t pass it up and glad I didn&rsquo;t. This is what I have to report: 
 
I managed to finish this series in 4 days (would have been 3 but life gets in the way) it&rsquo;s been a long time since I have marathoned a series, so when it happens, I know I really enjoyed. This series has it all: action, suspense, drama, but most importantly it has substance. When you finish a series of this caliber you know you have just finished something great, something you know you will definitely re-watch down the road.   
 
The plot is intriguing and through the massive 72 episode series I can&rsquo;t recall a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; or lack substance episode, everything was concrete and rock solid. The art is fantastic considering an early 80s series, the sound is amazing (I have lost count as to how many times I have listened to the OP and ED of this series). The real enjoyment offered by musashi no ken is definitely the characters. No character is simply placed in the series without a purpose. Each one is defined, and not forgotten throughout the series. The series combines the badass of Hajime no ippo and the amazing aspects of Major (being able to see the main character grow from a young age to an adult gradually throughout the series). 
  
This series rejuvenated my passion for Kendo that I had sadly stopped two years ago (now going 2 weeks strong back into practice). This series can be enjoyed by everyone, kendo enthusiast, anime sports fans, and general anime fans looking for a superb series that offers a great storyline and an outstanding cast. If this sounds like your cup of tea, look no further. Find Musashi no ken, and watch it. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.

","['Action', 'Historical', 'Mystery']","Words convey a lot of things; our thoughts, our memories, our feelings, and everything else we can imagine are written and recorded into history. Speaking of history, how long has it been since we last saw that adorable, gluttonous, but also intelligent black princess by the name of Dalian ""Kuro no Yomihime, Black Reading Princess”? Too long, I'd say! It's been over a year and our Black Biblioprincess returns in this special episode with her partner, Huey. We miss her and it's here in this episode that we see Dalian who once again presents some supernatural mystery. 
 
Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime (also known as The Mystic Archives of Dantalian: Ibarahime) is a special all new original episode contained within the fifth volume of Chako Abeno's Dantalian no Shoka manga adaptation. For any die hard fans of the original series, this special episode should be a special moment. 
 
Though it has been long, Dalian returns as her usual self. From the very beginning, she begins complaining just about...everything. And of course, her stomach speaks for herself just like from the original series. Just give her a candy and she'll shut up. Then, there's also Huey who returns in his usual role and maintains a calm composure despite Dalian's 24/7 complaining. 
 
Being known as part of the supernatural mystery genre, this episode brings forth some mystery. Surprised? You might be. That's because most OVA or special episodes these days are often one of those beach, onsen, summer festival cliches. Yet, Dantalian sticks with its style of mystery and doesn't fall into the cliches. That's just one of the little gadgets that makes this special episode unique in its way. 
 
However, let's remember that the original series wasn't exactly a hit smash, or at least in my opinion. It lacked smoothness and tries to characterize its characters too much. Needless to say, the characters' personalities does not balance although they sure bring out entertainment by just watching Dalian and Huey battle it out and about verbally using non magical words. But drop the arguments in this episode because a new character brings forth some trouble for the duo. Working together, the duo once again delivers just deserts. 
 
As for the animation, it's just alright. Gainax once again is in charge here but nothing much has changed. The episode retains its 1950s feeling of the old English Ages that brings out some realism. The Victorian like dress that Dalian wears retains its original design while Huey still wears his signature hat (see the promo poster if you don't believe me). 
 
The music/soundtrack doesn't change much either in this episode. It still has the usual choir music tone and the English style soundtrack. It retains its classical style and I do have to admit, it brings back some nostologia of the old school music. It is definitely well choreographed with the ED song being once again a smash hit in the strangeness department. 
 
Overall, Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime is one of those episodes that gives the fans a heads up that the original series is still something to treasure like words in a book, the words written from our memories, or the words delivered by our feelings. However, it once again lacks story or characterization just like the original series. The art is also nothing special to take notice of despite its subjective realism. On the other hand, the soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ears that is appealing and gives off the audio tone which reflects the classical style of the English Ages. It's difficult to say if this is enjoyable for me or not as it lacks originality (aka the Gosick clone theory). However, it brings back some nostologia and I'll leave it at that. Whether you'll like the episode or not is up to you to decide. Maybe, you can write your thoughts and record them in a book, come back later, and then think about it.

It's the running gag of Ben Johnson episode where animation staff reuse the New Years footage; Yorozuya would sit around the kotatsu eating a bowl of tangerines. They discuss elaborate subjects, Shinpachi complains about reusing animation footage, and then Gin-chan always ending the gag with a pointless announcement.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Parody', 'Samurai', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","This is about a big announcement.

That is, of course, after the subjective appraisal of time passing, which, as they admit, is like a stuck record. 
 
This effectively is an introduction to Gintama', but doesn't actually have anything to do with the Benizakura arc.  It ends with trailers from the following episodes, but other than that the meta-reflection and ruminations permeate the narrative.

The time machine was very cool. After episode 3, he kept yelling inside the house like doraemon, waking up his brother. I fell asleep on the couch in episode 3 though so i can't really talk about it. Ryugo was all about it though! The pacing can be slow sometimes, but the characters are very well done which helps make up for it. After episode 5 we went outside and played catch and he wouldn't stop talking about it. I've never seen him so animated in my life. This show is truly a blessing for my family, it will go down in anime history as a classic family show.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Sports', 'Drama', 'Shounen']","This anime is by far my #1 favorite. In this review I will not just be reviewing Rising, but the entirety of the anime seasons (Hajime No Ippo, New Challenger, and Rising). The movies themselves are good, but will not be included here. 
 
Hajime No Ippo is a long running anime with about ~125-127 total. I first learned about it from a friend and this is probably the 3rd or 4th anime I've watched (the others were fairly short). At first I was apprehensive about watching this due to its length and it being only about boxing.. but now that I've finished it, I'm left wanting more. This series is what really makes me appreciate anime and its last episodes are always on my mind, along with all the good moments I've had throughout watching its run. This anime has amazing storytelling, hilarious comedy, THE best character development I've ever seen, great action sequences, and the most importantly; this show has a lot of heart. While there are many animes out there with some of these good elements, none of them pull them off as perfectly as this one does. The funny thing is, most people find their favorite animes through their favorite characters (whom they relate to), and while there are certain characteristics of the characters that are relatable; there are none that I can truly relate to entirely. With that said, there is no bias here. 
 
This speaks for the entirety of the series. Since this is on the Hajime No Ippo: Rising section, I may as well review this season specifically a little bit. I'm not going to lie, the first 2 episodes were ok, they're nothing special. The real enjoyment begins at episode 3 and up. Its hard to say that this season is the best one given how long the first season is, but this one is definitely the most memorable due to the way it executed the story, allowing you to remember the whole season instead of chunks of it (like the first season, which may be because of its length). Something that may be considered negative is the fact that Ippo is only the center of the season through the first half of it (maybe up to ep17?). But it makes up for it by paying more attention to some of the characters who have had less development in the last 2 seasons. After Shimabukuro, all of the main fights are good... of Bryan Hawk quality. Finally, this season just had so much heart, especially at the end. This piece is a minor spoiler, but the last 2 episodes focus on the past with Coach Kamogawa/Nekota and it is a MUST watch. Out of all the episodes of the series, the last 2 are a strong mix of sadness/happiness that will leave a mark in the hearts of anyone whos followed the series from the beginning.

       Helpful First of all a big thanks to George Morikawa because he did something nearly impossible with Hajime no Ippo. He managed to keep his story interesting and his comedy fresh even after all these years. Sure it has it’s weaknesses(for example some short chapters in the manga plus some repeated stuff in the story etc) but it is still a great accomplishment that only a few are capable of. 
 
The story is about Ippo a kid without any purpose in his life and fate decides to make a boxer out of him. This season focuses on his challenges to keep his special move sharp and fresh, the Dempsey roll. in the manga the reason for the focus on the Dempsey Roll is explained better but since madhouse tried to handpick parts of the story there had to be some changes so they could fill it all in their schedule which is still no biggie since Ippo is not the best part of the story for me anyway(cause most of the times we know he is gonna win so it takes the tension away for me at least). His coach Kamogawa and his hero Takamura are the best parts and both get to shine in this season. Takamura aimed to rule 6 classes and his fights are always exciting and we get to see his second conquest in this season with a classier opponent this time, Eagle. A man that is exactly the opposite of Hawk, not just in style but also in personality. This is specially for American  so mangaka could show better to them that he is not against Americans! 
 
Madhouse decided to put the best part at the end of the season of course and along with some changes they put the Kamogawa background story at the end of this season which is probably the best part of the whole story and it explains why Kamogawa and Nekota are in their current state(plus Dankichi). As for the other characters Aoki and Kimura are mostly for comical relief like most of the times (even Aoki’s serious fight was funny and unreal probably on purpose) and Manabu is yet to reach his best condition in the manga but he is not liked by many it seems so I guess it’s for the best. (I actually like his character specially his expressions during matches and his second fight with Imai but he seems to me just like an extra character just to extend the story and doesn't add anything meaningful. I get it that he is there to show the growth of next generation but if it is going to be the similar rivalry thing that happened in the previous generations then who cares?!...). as for female characters…sigh, Sport genre and good female characters usually don’t go hand to hand(there are some strong or useful ones in some stories still as characters they are not that interesting). also this season shows one of the key messages the manga has: the importance of rivals. 
 
The animation doesn’t seem too much improved to be honest specially when you watch Kuroko no baske’s second season and see the improvement there in the short time it had from it’s previous season(although they didn't keep it up till the end) but it still feels a little cleaner and sharper than before. voice acting is strong just like previous seasons although Kamogawa’s voice actor passed away (rest in peace) so they had to replace him. Sadly they replaced him with Miguel’s voice actor but many probably don’t even remember Miguel so who cares and they might not even adopt Wally’s story so he might not be needed since if there is going to be a fourth season they might go for another epic fight or something (Volg’s fight would be good if they could somehow include it too since they had to show Volg this time too so it would be cooler narrative-wise but guess for that reason they should go for Randy J too.). also Coach’s voice in his earlier days didn't fit him(it is done by Mamoru Miyano mostly famous for Light Yagami) it was obvious they were just trying to use a famous Voice actor cause he is an important character but to be honest the fact that it doesn't fit is not a bad thing cause not all characters should have voices that matches their faces or style and as long as voice actors do their job fine they are fine. As for OP and ED I didn’t enjoy them although they made a smart use of a front page of one of the chapters in the ED which I liked. 
 
2013 was filled with great sport anime like Yowamushi pedal, Kuroko no Baske Season 2 and Diamond No Ace and sport fans are hopefully pleased. Hajime no Ippo Rising doesn't lose to those anime of course and it is a worthy adaptation. also Hopefully George Morikawa will start another Takamura fight soon or something as epic so Madhouse gets more tempted for another season.

This anime is based on the manga with the same title; it begins as a comical parody of Tarzan. The first several episodes are comedies, but the rest of the series consists of (rather) serious episodes. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","*First review and mild spoilers please bear with me*  
 
So Jungle no Ouja Taa-chan or Jungle King Tar-chan for the English title is an anime that aired in the 90s though the original source material, the manga started publishing in the 80s and got lots of more volumes than the anime only covered with it's 50 episodes length which to me is a good thing anyways given how awful this anime is but I'm sure my rating for this spoiled it already, yes I did end up hating it and let me explain my reasons as to why.  
 
Plot: 
 
Basically there is none but I didn't go into this expecting it anyways, true it starts out very episodic and heavily focused on the comedy aspect of it which they fail miserably at or maybe succeed at if you are 12 years old and like piss/poop jokes with the occasional boner jokes because those are just too funny or maybe it's just me having no humor these days. Then we got the serious arcs which are basically just tournament arcs which not many anime can pull off even making interesting and again I know this is an older anime but it still failed to even make me remotely interested in them when all that happens are repeat things like Tarzan and his friends always beating up the bad guys and the characters from that arc gets their happy endings and you never see them again as they are quickly forgotten and back to Africa again. Only the first arc was a bit different in the sense that another character from that arc now joined Tarzan's gang and became a regular but that's it. Otherwise it's Africa>new tournament arc>Africa>new tournament arc etc and it's never anything else so overall there really is no plot to this anime, no overarching nemesis or anything of the like only the tournament arc villains that are just there and they are never a real threat and once their arc is done so are they. I like my plot being good or even there be some at all but there is something I prioritize more than plot and that is what we come to next.  
 
Characters:  
 
Oh boy... where to even start when there was literally no character I liked in this anime, lets get the annoying ones out of the way before the bland like Jane...and in particular fat Jane because there is a difference as clearly showed in the past when NOT living in Africa she was kind, sexy and a total fit for Tarzan (cover really fooled me, false advertising yo!) but then somehow she got lazy and fat out in Africa in the present? I thought it would be the opposite that living without technology and society would make you work out more for stuff like food, building huts, just trying to survive in general but apparently not in this case. She constantly treats Tarzan like shit and gets jealous on every female introduced with their ALWAYS great bodies too she wishes she still have but never once do the fat joke go away as I thought it would do so if you read this review and that thought cross your mind then yeah, it never goes away and not her irredeemable behavior either. Atleast she got less annoying in the tournament arcs but not by much. And then we got our bland MC Tarzan that just take all this stuff, acts like an idiot all the time and being a pervert that always gets boners whenever he see the newly introduced female in each episodes and again the cover giving me the wrong impression because here I thought he would be sort of stoic badass that protects the jungle but I guess I've watched too much Fist of the North Star so maybe that's my fault for thinking that but still doesn't make his character any less bland, or maybe he's annoying too.  
 
When it comes to the supporting cast then they are all over the place like Helen, the first girl introduced that had a crush on Tarzan quickly got forgotten even though technically she was still there at their place in Africa but I guess no one cared anymore once they ditched her always when they took off to the country tournaments took place in never taking her with them, oh well. Ryou and Pedro are just fine, not too much personality to even distinguish between them tbh, both are fighters that just want to learn more and get stronger, nothing wrong with that but not too interesting either and shame you never get much background info on these characters for me to give a shit about them, given how little I did it could have a impact. There is a character I genuinely liked though (is this my first thing I mention I actually liked?!) and that's Anabebe and his antics, his jokes and rivalry with Tarzan was pretty funny I have to say and there is a point he gets rich and that makes him like an entirely different characters and you just never knew with that guy what he would do next, sadly he got underused a lot more later on as it became more about Tarzan in general but still for me he was my favorite character in this whole mess.  
 
Artstyle & Sound: 
 
What were they even thinking when making these character designs? alright the bodies are fine both for the male & female, they are all respectively either buff or busty and they are all sexy with the exception of Jane which somehow got shorter when she became fat because that's an anime trope thing I guess... but what is up with those derpy faces? their mouth to nose ratio are so close to each other to it just looks weird with most of them having a huge chin, especially noticeable on all the females, so click on Jane's character profile pic here on MAL and you'll notice immediately, every female and some males are like that in this and it really bothered me at the start but then I got used to it later on but still that's not a very good design and it being old or based on the original source is no excuse, the mouths could be just a little more closer to the chin like come on now. It's also weird when so many of them just looks the same but with different hairstyle/hair-colors, it's like they are all the same design with just added accessory on their head. Most of them do look different but there were just some minor characters that looked too much like some of the main cast so it made me confused sometimes but that was fine since it was only the minor characters that showed up in the tournament arcs.  
 
As for sound I'm sure they only really got the composer to make 2-3 different OSTs that gets used throughout the whole anime, also the first theme song gets used a lot in hype moments where Tarzan punch out someone and even though they always repeat I have to say I am a fan of that song and it did actually make those moments more hype even for me that disliked this anime those were still one of the better moments to those dragged out tournament arcs.  
 
So those are my thoughts, wouldn't really recommend it to anyone and it was 50 episodes long too and the manga cover much more than that and hey maybe that is better paced etc than this garbage but after this I wouldn't even want to give it a try and it's barely even translated anyways. Even to people that want their ""manly men"" fix from the 80/90s like Fist of the North Star, JoJo, Be A Man! Samurai School etc they won't get it here, trust me. 

          
 
       Helpful I'm surprised there's not a review for this already, given how despite how obscure it is, this series is still within the top 2000 on this site.  
 
Tar-chan is an obscure battle Shonen that barely receives any notice within not just the anime community, but even in Japan, with it's sole appearance outside of it's own anime/manga being it's titular protagonist being playable in two Jump crossover games. This lack of popularity would have you thinking this series isn't that good at all, wouldn't it? Well, you'd be wrong. 
 
Tar-chan's plot, like many Jump series, is one that transitions from a comedic series into a battle series with constantly stronger foes. Whilst this would make many shout ""Yet another Battle Shonen"", this contains a lot more than the previous sentence would give at face value. 
 
The plot of Tar-chan changes with each arc, though as an entirety, it follows the story of a Tarzan parody known as Tar-chan, a man raised in the African Savannah by a chimp named Eikichi and a Gorilla named Gori-san, as he protects his homeland from Poachers along with his friends the African Tribal warrior Anabebe, the French Karate expert Pedro and the Chinese martial arts Ki master Ryo Shihan. This isn't the only struggle he faces, with him also maintaining his rocky relationship with his overweight wife Jane, with him constantly pushing the line by looking at other women. 
 
The early episodes have an episodic setup and are used to introduce and flesh out the cast. When the China Arc starts, the series then shifts into an action series focused on 1 on 1 Tournament battles, with Tar-chan and his friends facing Ki using Kung-Fu experts, Cyborgs, Vampires and finally, a clone of Tar-chan. The previous sentence alone shows how much the series constantly changes, with this ability to keep it's plot fresh being what should keep you wanting to watch it. 
The set up of each arc itself is that of a standard Shonen, with the direction each series of battles in the arc shall go through being very straightforward. The series also relied on a lot of resolve power ups for Tar-chan, something unfortunately rampant in most Shonen series. What allows this plot to be good, however, is the drama found in the series. Whilst seeming like a silly series at first glance, it's in fact one with quite good settings and twists for each arc, with it's character writing for them being a point I'll elaborate on now. 
 
Story - 7/10 
 
This is one of the major pros to this series, as whilst many of the characters seem single-minded in their goals, they at least present enough emphasis on this to allow their personality to be fully established. The protagonist, Tar-chan, is in fact one of the most interesting Jump protagonists of the 90s due to him being a manly pacifist. His unique mix of honour, power and kindness is on a level comparable to such revered characters as Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin. The side characters of the series such as Tar-chan's brothers or the 5 strongest Vampires aren't too interesting, though they at least have the pro of presenting a good deal of manliness in their actions. Tar-chan's clone in the final arc, Iron Mask, presents perhaps the best use of character writing in this entire series, with him being a man with the psychology of a child, who's innocence and morals are twisted by his corrupt ""mother"". Many of the other enemies are tragic villains as well, though he was without a doubt the best written. 
 
Characters - 7/10 
 
The sound for the series is OK. Tar-chan's seiyuu is unfortunately, not a good choice, since he was a DJ with no experience in voice acting, which was critical in ruining some of the more emotional scenes. The other voices are fine, however. As for the soundtrack, it isn't too outstanding, though many of the tracks, particularly the instrumental renditions of the openings, are diamonds in the ruff. The openings and endings are pretty good too, with the 2nd opening being, in my opinion, one of the most catchy openings of the 90s, on par with any of the heavily praised openings of that decade. 
 
Sound - 7/10 
 
As for the art, this is one of the series flaws. Whilst it does an excellent job in the body proportions of both male and female characters, with great attention to showing muscular physiques, the facial designs are quite poor by comparison. 
 
Art - 5/10 
 
For the reasons I mentioned, ranging from it's creativity in changing the plot's settings, the character writing and it being a manly series, I found it to be a fairly enjoyable watch, though it would be a lot better if there were more reliable subs for it. Hopefully, it will get licenced by Discotek or another good official subber of non-mainstream anime.  
 
Enjoyment - 7/10 
 
Overall, Tar-chan is an obscure, yet creative series that deserves far more attention. If you enjoy battle Shonen, high variation in settings or simply series of the MANLY genre, this is one to give consideration to.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","This is a review that contains no spoilers, because that is the purpose of every review because reviews are meant for people who haven't watched or read something. You may wonder why have I wrote a review when I have only watched 6 episodes and the answer is simple, it didn't try to do anything new or follow a deep story with deep characters and every episode seemed like a waste of time  because it didn't lead up to anywhere and this show, objectively speaking isn't worth an 8,5/10 that it has and is overhyped by girls fangirling about the main couple who will finally be together moments before the series ends after a really long pointless journey. 
 
Story: Romance is a category that suffers a lot from cliches like every other category in anime and so does this anime. I had high expectations for this anime because I saw in it in a lot of ''best romance articles'' getting high places top 3 mostly. But when I got in to it was so boring that I couldn't stand it. Although it had a unique setting the maid cafe it didn't use that to it's advantage and just got nowhere, and the pacing was just extremely slow with forced romance by the mc (like every other stereotypical romance anime) and he is more mysterious than the 7 wonders of the world (although not so much in this case but still we get no information about him, his story, or his belief's). The story as I said previously it got nowhere or at least for most of the time with no depth at all although it had some things that it could focus on like how her family struggles because they have no money and that could lead to having some psychological effect on her like her behaviour. But nonetheless nothing new as the story goes.  
 
Characters: The side characters are bland and useless (even more than Sakura) that are there just to be there with no purpose or meaning  with no character development. The guy mc is the classic model of Victoria secret, being perfect in everything and having almost no bad things on him which draws all the fan girls making the show popular and giving it's much needed attention. The girl mc is the classic high tempered shoujo mc that has the mc throwing himself at her, saying clearly that he loves her but she still keeps rejecting him. 
 
Enjoyment: I found this show really hard to enjoy as this review shows, because except from all these aspects like story and characters that were boring and with no interest at all, the only part of the show that could have won me, the comedy was just repetitive and and one-dimentional.  
 
All in all if you wanted to watch a fresh romance anime with a good story and characters I am afraid this is not for you. Also this is the first time for me writing a review so please be gentle :P. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Ahhh Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, I found this anime while scavenging for a romance anime in the top tier list. At first, you might not get really into it, but a couple of episodes in and BAM!, you just can't stop watching it, you'll binge the shit out of it!. 
 
 
Some might say that it's like a lot of the anime before it, same story and what not, but at this time and age, it's kind of rare to find a new story with a different plot. Anyway, Kaichou wa Maid-sama! did this story better than a lot of the alternatives. 
 
 
It's amazing and really puts you in a good mood. Just watching how the 3 idiots interact with their favorite maid is good comedy. I highly recommend this to anyone feeling gloomy and down, it's a real upper in my opinion. My only dispute is that so far there's no second season, and it's like there's isn't going to be, ever ! 
 
 
I really hope, as many of my reviews indicate, that miraculously, there will be a second season. But if not, it's still a great watch and you're going to enjoy it.  
 
 
As usual, please add me if you think my review helped you or you have similar taste, enjoy ! 

          
 
       Helpful Being the shoujo anime lover I am, I had to watch this! Especially after watching Special A and everybody commenting on how similar special A was to Maid- sama! Well, now to the review. 
The reason most people like this is because Usui is damn hot. That's right, he IS damn hot but that's not the point. The story in itself was not that great, it felt like the main character's relationship could have progressed way more than it did. As for the characters, I really liked Misaki's tsundere attitude, while she could kick ass, she still was good and fair with the boys whom she supposedly 'hated'. Now, for Usui. 
Everybody ADORES Usui, but I personally wouldn't want him for a boyfriend. I get it that he loves Misaki but...why must the story alwats place her in situations where she must be saved by Usui? 
Usually, I prefer more flawed, real characters. For me, Usui is just too good at everything, and yet I don't like his approaches at times ( like the back hickey! really?). He's too perverted and clichéd.  
Overall, I thought it was quite good though. Above all, it is really funny, that's what saves the show
